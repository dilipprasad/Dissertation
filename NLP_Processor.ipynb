Die neue Bundesregierung unter Bundeskanzler Helmut Schmidt f\\u00fchrt die bisherige Ost- und Deutschlandpolitik fort und bem\\u00fcht sich gleicherma\\u00dfen um eine Intensivierung der transatlantischen Beziehungen. Die mit der \\u00d6lkrise 1973/74 einhergehende wirtschaftliche Rezession erschwert die Umsetzung der innenpolitischen Reformvorhaben. Angesichts der begrenzten Energieressourcen gewinnen Pl\\u00e4ne zur Kernkraftnutzung zus\\u00e4tzlichen Auftrieb.

Die Online-Version der edierten Kabinettsprotokolle steht seit 2003 im Internet bereit. Sie macht die f\\u00fcr die Erforschung der Geschichte der Bundesrepublik Deutschland zentrale Quelle der Kabinettsprotokolle einem deutlich breiteren Benutzerkreis zug\\u00e4nglich. Ihr entscheidender Mehrwert liegt in der Erleichterung und Erweiterung der Recherchem\\u00f6glichkeiten. Neben gezielter Suche und raschem Zugriff auch auf detaillierte Informationen erm\\u00f6glicht sie mittels kombinierter Suchstrategien auch Abfragen komplexer Sachverhalte sowie neue Methoden und Wege der Textauswertung. Gleichzeitig erleichtert sie durch ein Navigationssystem die Orientierung in einem immer umfangreicher werdenden Text. Ferner ist die digitale Version besonders dazu geeignet, das im Editionskonzept enthaltene System von Vor- und R\\u00fcckverweisen zu unterst\\u00fctzen. Eine Verlinkung der einzelnen Tagesordnungspunkte untereinander erlaubt es, den Beratungsverlauf im Kabinett und in seinen Aussch\\u00fcssen auch \\u00fcber die tradierten Band- und Jahresgrenzen hinaus im gesamten anwachsenden Corpus der Protokolltexte zu verfolgen.\\nNicht zuletzt besteht der Gewinn einer Internet-Version der Edition darin, die Quellenangaben in den Kommentaren der Kabinettsprotokolle mit den Bestands\\u00fcbersichten des Bundesarchivs zu verkn\\u00fcpfen. Mit diesem Zugang zu anderen, teilweise erst im Aufbau befindlichen Online-Dienstleistungen entspricht das Bundesarchiv auch der Zielsetzung der Bundesregierung, alle internetf\\u00e4higen Dienstleistungen der Bundesverwaltung online bereitzustellen.\\nDer wesentliche Vorteil der digitalen Version der Edition ist die Mehrdimensionalit\\u00e4t des Zugriffs. Die weiterhin im Buchdruck erscheinende Version des Editionswerks, die sequentielles Lesen erm\\u00f6glicht und Zitierbarkeit auch in klassischer Form sicherstellt, beh\\u00e4lt daneben ihre Berechtigung.\\nIn Erg\\u00e4nzung des wissenschaftlichen Editionswerks in seiner gedruckten und seiner digitalen Form konnte nach der erforderlichen Anpassung der rechtlichen Rahmenbedingungen das Bundesarchiv 2013 auf der vorliegenden Internet-Seite in einem Zuge diejenigen bereits schutzfristfreien 13 Jahrg\\u00e4nge der Kabinettsprotokolle der \\u00d6ffentlichkeit pr\\u00e4sentieren, zu denen bis dahin noch kein editorischer Sachkommentar erstellt worden war. Seitdem werden diese insoweit noch unkommentierten, jedoch schon textkritisch bearbeiteten Protokolle kontinuierlich entlang der archivrechtlichen 30-Jahresschutzfrist jahrgangsweise erg\\u00e4nzt. Sie sind in klarer Abgrenzung von den bereits abschlie\\u00dfend kommentierten Protokolljahrg\\u00e4ngen auf der Ebene der einzelnen Tagesordnungspunkte entsprechend gekennzeichnet, und sie bleiben als \\u00dcbergangsangebot jeweils nur solange im Internet eingestellt, bis sie durch die einschl\\u00e4gigen Jahrg\\u00e4nge der Online-Version der Edition nach deren Abschluss ersetzt werden k\\u00f6nnen.\"}\n",

Oldenbourg Verlag M\\u00fcnchen 2003ISBN 3-486-56753-5\\nEinen Schwerpunkt der Kabinettsberatungen des Jahres 1960 bildet neben der Frage eines beschleunigten Ausbaus der EWG weiterhin die Berlin-Krise, die sich nach dem Scheitern der Pariser Gipfelkonferenz im Mai erneut versch\\u00e4rft. Repressalien der DDR im Reiseverkehr beantwortet die Bundesrepublik mit der K\\u00fcndigung des Interzonenhandelsabkommens. Ausf\\u00fchrlich dokumentiert ist auf innenpolitischem Gebiet insbesondere die heftige Auseinandersetzung mit den L\\u00e4ndern um das zweite Fernsehprogramm. 15 Jahre nach Kriegsende r\\u00fcckt ferner als Folge der antisemitischen Vorf\\u00e4lle der Jahreswende 1959/1960 erstmals der Umgang mit der nationalsozialistischen Vergangenheit in das Blickfeld des Kabinetts. Die wirtschaftliche Lage ist gekennzeichnet durch eine anhaltende Hochkonjunktur und ein weiteres Absinken der Arbeitslosigkeit. Der Bundeshaushalt \\u00fcberschreitet erstmals die 40 Milliarden-Grenze. Vor dem Hintergrund von Konzentrationserscheinungen in der Wirtschaft f\\u00fchrt die Bundesregierung Ma\\u00dfnahmen zur Eigentumsbildung breiter Schichten wie die Privatisierung des Volkswagenwerkes und das Verm\\u00f6gensbildungsgesetz sowie zur F\\u00f6rderung des Mittelstandes fort.\"}\n",

Jeder dieser Funktionsbereiche ist als eigene Seite realisiert und gegliedert. Ein allgemeine Funktion in der Utility-Leiste am oberen Bildschirmrand enth\\u00e4lt die  Hilfeseiten und das Impressum.\\nUnter der Rubrik \\u201eEdition\\u201c sind alle B\\u00e4nde der Edition (Kabinettsprotokolle und Kabinettsausch\\u00fcsse), die Kurzbiographien, die Netzeditionsgrunds\\u00e4tze und die Gesch\\u00e4ftsordnung der Bundesregierung mit einem gemeinsamen Inhaltsverzeichnis versammelt. Das Inhaltsverzeichnis der Edition und des jeweils ausgew\\u00e4hlten Bandes bzw. Teilbereichs ist hier abrufbar. Aus dem Inhaltsverzeichnis heraus kann das jeweilige Dokument oder der Tagesordnungspunkt aufgerufen werden. Dies bewirkt einen Wechsel in den Band.\\n\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\nnach oben\\n\\u00a0SeitenaufbauJede Seite ist in mehrere Teilbereiche unterteilt:\\nTextFunktionenNavigationsbaumNavigationsmen\\u00fcServicelinksBandbilderStandortLayoutmenuUtility-LeisteDiese Bereiche kehren auf jeder Seite wieder und werden in der Darstellung f\\u00fcr Screenreader durch Zwischen\\u00fcberschriften besonders hervorgehoben. Dies kann durch eine \\u201eTextansicht\\u201c ebenfalls erreicht werden. Diese Ansicht bewirkt das Abschalten der visuellen Formatierungen und wird in geeigneten Browsern, wie Firefox, Mozilla und Opera, durch den Befehl \\u201eAnsicht > Webseiten-Stil > Kein Stil\\u201c bzw. \\u201eAnsicht > Stil > Nutzer-Modus\\u201c erreicht.\\n\\nnach oben\\n\\u00a0Beschreibung der Teilbereiche einer SeiteMit der Bezeichnung \\u201eText\\u201c ist der Protokolltext bzw. das Inhaltsverzeichnis als Hauptinhalt der Seite benannt.Mit \\u201eFunktionen\\u201c ist die Auswahl zwischen Edition und Suche gemeint. \\u201eSuche\\u201c steht dabei f\\u00fcr das Suchformular, \\u201eEdition f\\u00fcr das Inhaltsverzeichnis aller verf\\u00fcgbaren B\\u00e4nde. \\u201eNavigationsmen\\u00fc\\u201c ist die Bezeichnung f\\u00fcr das Bl\\u00e4ttern in den B\\u00e4nden. Hier k\\u00f6nnen die im Buch vorgehenden und nachfolgenden Textabschnitte ausgew\\u00e4hlt werden, aber auch der vorige oder n\\u00e4chste Abschnitt gleicher Art. Ebenso ist das Inhaltsverzeichnis stets erreichbar sowie der Anfang und das Ende des Textes auf der aktuellen Seite. Das Navigationsmen\\u00fc ist mit Access-Keys hinterlegt, die im Folgenden beschrieben werden. Das Navigationsmen\\u00fc kann wahlweise ein- oder ausgeblendet werden. \\u201eNavigationsbaum\\u201c bezeichnet die Darstellung des Inhaltsverzeichnisses sowie der Unterpunkte in Form einer Hierarchie. Ein Abschnitt mit Unterpunkten bildet einen Knoten. Unter Knoten sind die Inhaltseinheiten zu verstehen, Unterpunkte k\\u00f6nnen die Tagesordnungspunkte eines Protokolls sein, oder die Protokolle eines Bandes.\\u201eServicelinks\\u201c sind Links auf allgemeine Seiten des Bundesarchivs, die aus der Online-Edition herausf\\u00fchren.\\u201eBandbilder\\u201c sind jeweils f\\u00fcnf Bilder, die aus der gedruckten Edition entnommen wurden und jeweils zu einem Band eingeblendet werden. Die Bilder sind mit einem alternativen Text beschrieben.\\u201eStandort\\u201c stellt den Weg vom Anfangspunkt der Edition, \\u00fcber die gew\\u00e4hlte Serie, den aktuellen Band und Abschnitt darin zum angezeigten Textabschnitt  . Die jeweils \\u00fcbergeordneten Texteinheiten sind durch Links erreichbar. Innerhalb eines Bandes wird mit dem Wort \\u201eStandort\\u201c im Navigationsbaum die Position im Inhaltsverzeichnis markiert.Das \\u201eLayoutmen\\u00fc\\u201c erm\\u00f6glicht die Wahl der Darstellung. Die Fu\\u00dfnoten k\\u00f6nnen entweder hinter jedem Absatz oder am Ende der Seite angezeigt werden. Der Text kann kontrastreduziert sowohl in schwarz auf wei\\u00dfem Grund  als auch in wei\\u00df auf schwarzem Grund angezeigt werden. Das Inhaltsverzeichnis kann ausgeblendet werden, die Funktionen \\u201eSuche\\u201c, \\u201eInhaltsverzeichnis der Edition\\u201c und \\u201eHilfe\\u201c werden nicht ausgeblendet und \\u00fcber das Layoutmen\\u00fc kann das Inhaltsverzeichnis auch wieder eingeschaltet werden.\\nnach oben\\n\\u00a0Access KeysDie Links auf die Funktionen der Seite k\\u00f6nnen mit Abk\\u00fcrzungen (sog.

Zur leichteren Orientierung wird in der ersten \\u00dcberschrift der Bezeichner f\\u00fcr die Position im aktuellen Band und der inhaltliche Titel der Seite genannt. Diese Information geht auch aus dem HTML-Titel der Seite und der Adresse der Seite hervor. Die Bandangabe ist auch ein Teil der Adresse jeder Seite.Es folgen Kurzverweise \\u201eZum Text\\u201c, \\u201eZum Suchformular\\u201c, \\u201eZu den Funktionen\\u201c und \\u201eZum Navigationsmen\\u00fc\\u201c. Auf Seiten, die Fu\\u00dfnoten enthalten, kann die erste Fu\\u00dfnote direkt angesteuert werden. Auf Seiten, die aus einer Suche aufgerufen wurden, kann der erste Suchtreffer direkt angesteuert werden. Dann folgen hinter \\u201eSpringe direkt zu:\\u201c die Verweise auf die wiederkehrenden Bereiche jeder Seite.Die wiederkehrenden Bereiche werden durch \\u00dcberschriften eingeleitet, die zur Strukturierung der Seite dargestellt werden. Der Text der beschriebenen abk\\u00fcrzenden Links und die strukturierenden \\u00dcberschriften sind nicht Teil der Edition. Nur der Abschnitt zwischen den \\u00dcberschriften \\u201eText\\u201c und \\u201eExtras (Fu\\u00dfzeile)\\u201c auf den Seiten eines Bandes entstammt der Edition.\\n\\n\\nnach oben\\n\\u00a0BilderBilder werden regelm\\u00e4\\u00dfig in der Bildleiste zu jedem Band eingeblendet und treten vereinzelt im Text der Edition auf. Alle Bilder der Bildleiste sind der Buchedition entnommen und durch einen alternativen Text beschrieben. Die Beschreibung der Bilder war in der gedruckten Fassung der Edition nicht in jedem Fall enthalten. Die Bildbeschreibung wird als alternativer Link auf eine Seite \\u201elongdesc.html\\u201c angegeben und anstelle des Bildes eingeblendet. Wird in der Bildbeschreibung auf Tagesordnungspunkte verwiesen, sind diese durch einen Link erreichbar.\\nAbbildungen im Text, die in schwarz auf wei\\u00dfem Grund vorliegen, werden in der invertierten Darstellung einer Seite ebenfalls invertiert dargestellt.\\n\\n\\nnach oben\\n\\u00a0TabellenZur Formatierung des Textes werden Tabellen nur dann eingesetzt, wenn ihr Inhalt ohne Sinnentstellung hintereinander lesbar ist. Die Darstellung tabellarischer Inhalte wurde durch die Vergabe von Spalten- und Zeilen\\u00fcberschriften verbessert. Eine Zusammenfassung des Inhalts wurde f\\u00fcr die Online-Edition ebenfalls erg\\u00e4nzt, auch sie ist kein Bestandteil der gedruckten Fassung.\\nnach oben\\n\\u00a0Suche in den Kabinettsprotokollen\\u00a01. KurzfassungAllgemeines zur Volltextsuche:Durch einen Klick auf den Schriftzug \\u00bbSuche\\u00ab \\u00f6ffnen Sie die Recherchemaske am linken Bildrand. Jetzt haben Sie die M\\u00f6glichkeit zu einer Volltextsuche, d.h., Sie k\\u00f6nnen nach einzelnen W\\u00f6rtern (z.B. \\u00bbGipfelkonferenz\\u00ab) oder nach l\\u00e4ngeren Textpassagen suchen (z.B. \\u00bbAnhebung der Verkehrstarife\\u00ab). Findet die Suchmaschine das von Ihnen eingegebene Wort bzw. die W\\u00f6rter, so erscheinen im mittleren Teil der Seite die erzielten Treffer. Die Trefferdarstellung verwendet Zwischen\\u00fcberschriften, welche die Zugeh\\u00f6rigkeit der Treffer zu einem Band bzw. Bandtyp markieren. Bei band\\u00fcbergreifender Recherche erfolgt eine chronologische Darstellung. Die Treffer erscheinen in der Abfolge der Strukturteile eines Bandes; innerhalb der Protokolltexte sind sie chronologisch angeordnet. Sollten mehr als die eingestellten anzuzeigenden Treffer gefunden worden sein, wird unterhalb der Bandbilder und am Fu\\u00df der Seite am rechten Rand eine Navigationshilfe f\\u00fcr die Trefferseiten eingeblendet.Die gefundenen Treffer werden als Links erstellt. Wenn Sie auf einen Treffer klicken, wird das Hauptfenster aktualisiert. Dort erscheint der erste Absatz, in dem das gesuchte Wort bzw. die gesuchten W\\u00f6rter gefunden wurden. In der Navigationshilfe auf der linken Seite und in der Standortleiste unterhalb der Bandbilder ist die entsprechende Stelle markiert, die das aktualisierte Textelement im gesamten Textcorpus einnimmt. Das Suchwort bzw. die Suchw\\u00f6rter werden gelb hervorgehoben. Bei mehreren Suchtreffern auf einer Seite ist ein Treffer jeweils mit dem n\\u00e4chsten Absatz verlinkt, der den Folgetreffer enth\\u00e4lt.\\nnach oben\\n\\u00a02. LangfassungUm m\\u00f6glichst wenige und genaue Treffer zu erhalten, gibt es eine Vielzahl von Einschr\\u00e4nkungsm\\u00f6glichkeiten, die miteinander kombiniert werden k\\u00f6nnen.\\u00a0a) Suche mit Booleschen OperatorenUm Ihre Suche st\\u00e4rker einzuschr\\u00e4nken, k\\u00f6nnen Sie mehrere Suchbegriffe gleichzeitig eingeben und diese auf verschiedene Weise miteinander verkn\\u00fcpfen. Dabei gibt es folgende Verkn\\u00fcpfungsm\\u00f6glichkeiten:\\n1. \\u00bbAND\\u00ab: Dies ist die Standardverkn\\u00fcpfung. Geben Sie mehrere Begriffe in die Suchmaske ein, werden diese automatisch mit \\u00bbAND\\u00ab verkn\\u00fcpft. Bei dieser Verkn\\u00fcpfung werden Ihnen nur diejenigen Textstellen angezeigt, in denen beide Begriffe vorkommen. Geben Sie dazu ein \\u00bbAnhebung AND Verkehrstarife\\u00ab.2. \\u00bbOR\\u00ab: Wenn Sie z.B. die Begriffe \\u00bbAnhebung\\u00ab und \\u00bbVerkehrstarife\\u00ab eingeben, dann erhalten Sie alle Textstellen, in denen entweder das eine oder das andere Wort oder beide W\\u00f6rter zusammen vorkommen.3. \\u00bbNOT\\u00ab: Durch diesen Operator k\\u00f6nnen Sie W\\u00f6rter ausschlie\\u00dfen. Wenn Sie \\u00bbAdenauer NOT Erhard\\u00ab eingeben, so erhalten Sie nur Textstellen in denen der Begriff Adenauer vorkommt, Erhard aber nicht.4. \\u00bb+\\u00ab: Setzen Sie dieses Zeichen vor dasjenige Wort, das auf jeden Fall vorkommen soll. Wenn Sie z.B. eingeben \\u00bbAnhebung +Verkehrstarife\\u00ab, so erhalten Sie alle Textstellen angezeigt, in denen der Begriff \\u00bbVerkehrstarife\\u00ab vorkommt, jedoch nicht zwingend der Begriff \\u00bbAnhebung\\u00ab.5. Wildcard-Suche: Sucht alle Varianten eines Wortes; geben Sie z.B. \\u00bbVerkehr*\\u00ab ein, so erhalten Sie alle Textstellen, in denen W\\u00f6rter mit dem Anfangsbestandteil Verkehr auftauchen.6. Phrase-Suche: Sucht eine genaue Abfolge von Worten. Geben Sie z.B. \\u00bb\\\"Kampf dem Atomtod\\\"\\u00ab (mit Anf\\u00fchrungszeichen) ein, so erhalten Sie alle Textstellen, in denen diese drei W\\u00f6rter in dieser Reihenfolge vorkommen.\\u00a0b) Suche mit und ohne BegriffsbearbeitungIm Standardmodus wird die Suche mit \\u00bbgleicher Wortstamm\\u00ab durchgef\\u00fchrt, d.h., wenn Sie nach einem Wort in der Grundform suchen, werden auch Varianten mit abweichenden Endungen oder Pluralformen ber\\u00fccksichtigt. Suchen Sie den Begriff \\u00bbLand\\u00ab mit gleichem Wortstamm, finden Sie auch die W\\u00f6rter \\u00bbLandes\\u00ab und \\u00bbL\\u00e4nder\\u00ab. Sollten Sie diese Suchfunktion nicht w\\u00fcnschen, k\\u00f6nnen Sie im Men\\u00fc Begriffsbearbeitung die Suche \\u00bbgenaue Treffer\\u00ab w\\u00e4hlen.\\u00a0c) Auswahl Protokolle/BiographienIm der Standardeinstellung werden sowohl die B\\u00e4nde der Kabinettsprotokolle, der Kabinettsaussch\\u00fcsse als auch die band\\u00fcbergreifenden Kurzbiographien abgesucht. Sind Sie an einer Suche in nur einem dieser Bereiche interessiert, k\\u00f6nnen Sie diese \\u00fcber das Men\\u00fcfenster entsprechend einschr\\u00e4nken.\\u00a0d) ZeitraumIm Standardmodus werden alle B\\u00e4nde seit 1949 bis zum aktuellsten durchsucht. Eine chronologische Einschr\\u00e4nkung erfordert das Ausf\\u00fcllen beider Jahresfelder in der \\u00bbvon-bis-Suche\\u00ab.\\u00a0e) Einschr\\u00e4nkung der SuchgebieteIn der Standardeinstellung (Volltext) wird in allen Elementen der Edition der Kabinettsprotokolle nach den eingegebenen Begriffen gesucht. Wenn Sie beispielsweise das Wort \\u00bbOberl\\u00e4nder\\u00ab eingeben, so erhalten Sie z.B. Trefferanzeigen sowohl aus den Listen der Sitzungsteilnehmer, aus einzelnen Tagesordnungspunkten und aus der Einleitung.Sie k\\u00f6nnen jedoch auch individuell festlegen, welche Bereiche im Text bei Ihrer Suche ber\\u00fccksichtigt werden sollen. Im Men\\u00fc \\u00bbSuchbereich\\u00ab k\\u00f6nnen Sie folgende Auswahl treffen:1. Volltext: Dies ist die Standardeinstellung. Alle Elemente werden bei der Suche ber\\u00fccksichtigt.2. Fu\\u00dfnoten: Nur die Fu\\u00dfnoten werden durchsucht.3. Teilnehmer: Nur die Teilnehmerlisten in den Dokumentenk\\u00f6pfen der einzelnen Sitzungen werden durchsucht.4. TOP-\\u00dcberschrift: Nur die \\u00dcberschriften der einzelnen Tagesordnungspunkte werden bei der Suche ber\\u00fccksichtigt.5. Protokolltext: Nur die reinen Protokolltexte werden durchsucht. In B\\u00e4nden mit Wortprotokollen schlie\\u00dft das diese ein.6. Einleitung: Nur die Einleitungen werden durchsucht.\\u00a0f) Suche \\u00fcber PersonenlisteJeder Band enth\\u00e4lt den Auswahlpunkt \\u00bbPersonenliste\\u00ab, \\u00fcber den Sie alle in dem betreffenden Band in der ein oder anderen Weise vorkommenden Personen ermitteln k\\u00f6nnen. Klicken Sie in der A-Z-Liste auf einen Namen, so wird eine Suche nach dem Namen der betreffenden Person in der Eingrenzung auf den Band ausgel\\u00f6st.\\nnach oben\\n\\u00a0Suche in der barrierefreien VersionDie Suche in der barrierefreien Version entspricht der oben beschriebenen Suche.Am Anfang jeder Seite gibt es einen abk\\u00fcrzenden Link direkt \\u201eZum Suchformular\\u201c. Die Felder des Suchformulars sind durch Dr\\u00fccken der \\u201eTab\\u201c-Taste in der Reihenfolge nach ausw\\u00e4hlbar.\\u00a0SuchergebnisseEine Suche stellt die Ergebnisse im Text-Bereich der Seite dar. Dort sind die \\u00dcberschriften der Seiten mit Suchtreffern eingeblendet und verweisen auf die jeweilige Seite. Ebenfalls wird die Gesamtzahl der Suchtreffer angegeben und in welchem Block man sich befindet. Wurden mehr Seiten als in einem Block darstellbar gefunden, werden durchnumerierte Links zu den Folgebl\\u00f6cken mit Suchtreffern als Navigationsmen\\u00fc  angeboten. Sie sind auch \\u00fcber die Accesskeys wie folgt zu erreichen;6zur n\\u00e4chsten Block mit Treffern4zur vorhergehenden Block mit Treffern0zum Anfang des Textes, hier die Liste der Treffer, die durch die \\u00dcberschrift des Textteils dargestellt sind.\\u00a0Treffer auf der ErgebnisseiteBei Aktivierung eines Suchtreffers wird die jeweilige Seite aufgerufen. Am Anfang der Ergebnisseite wird ein weiterer Link eingeblendet, der auf den Absatz mit dem ersten Vorkommen des gesuchten Textes verweist. Im Titel dieses Links wird die Gesamtzahl der Abs\\u00e4tze mit Vorkommen des gesuchten Textes auf der Ergebnisseite angegeben. Von jedem Suchtreffer kann man auf den Anfang des n\\u00e4chsten Absatzes springen, der Suchtreffer enth\\u00e4lt. Dadurch wird der Fokus auf den Anfang des Kontextes gesetzt, in dem der gesuchte Text auftritt.Zus\\u00e4tzlich werden alle Suchtreffer auf einer Seite visuell durch einen gelben Hintergrund hervorgehoben.Auf die n\\u00e4chste Seite mit Treffern gelangt man durch Zur\\u00fcckgehen auf die Seite mit den Suchergebnissen. Dort ist die letzte Suche gespeichert und die n\\u00e4chste Seite mit Suchtreffern kann gew\\u00e4hlt werden.\\nnach oben\"}\n",

Oldenbourg Verlag M\\u00fcnchen 2002ISBN 978-3-486-56699-4\\nIm zehnten Jahr des Bestehens der Bundesrepublik Deutschland standen im Mittelpunkt der au\\u00dfenpolitischen Tagesordnungspunkte des Kabinetts insbesondere die Berlin-Krise, die Deutschlandfrage und damit eng verkn\\u00fcpft die Genfer Au\\u00dfenministerkonferenz der vier Siegerm\\u00e4chte. An diesen ergebnislos endenden Beratungen \\u00fcber die Zukunft Deutschlands nahmen erstmals Vertreter beider Teile Deutschlands am ber\\u00fchmt gewordenen \\u201eKatzentisch\\u201c teil. Zu wichtigen innenpolitischen Themen des Kabinetts geh\\u00f6rten u. a. die Auseinandersetzungen mit den Bundesl\\u00e4ndern um die Einrichtung eines zweiten Fernsehsenders, die Parteiengesetzgebung, die Neuordnung der sozialen Krankenversicherung, die Kriegsopferversorgung, die Ausgabe erster Volksaktien, der Abschluss der wirtschaftlichen Eingliederung des Saarlandes sowie die Wahl des zweiten Bundespr\\u00e4sidenten Heinrich L\\u00fcbke. Die Protokolle wiederspiegeln zudem die Auseinandersetzungen innerhalb der Bundesregierung \\u00fcber den Umgang mit der neuen Flagge der DDR, die aus Anlass des zehnten Jahrestages ihrer Gr\\u00fcndung erstmals mit hinzugef\\u00fcgtem Staatswappen gehisst wurde und den Alleinvertretungsanspruch der Bundesrepublik in Frage stellte. Trotz allgemeiner positiver Konjunkturbilanz mit einer heute unvorstellbar niedrigen Arbeitslosenquote von 2,6 % war die Bundesregierung wegen der anhaltenden Absatzkrise im Steinkohlenbergbau und der Preissteigerungen f\\u00fcr landwirtschaftliche Produkte zu eingreifenden Ma\\u00dfnahmen gezwungen. In einer gro\\u00dfen Debatte des Bundestages \\u00fcber die Justizpolitik und im Fall des Bundesvertriebenenministers Oberl\\u00e4nder hatte sich die Bundesregierung auch verst\\u00e4rkt mit dem Problem der nationalsozialistischen Vergangenheit auseinanderzusetzen.\"}\n",

Kabinettsaussch\\u00fcsse, zu deren Teilnehmerkreis Minister und Staatssekret\\u00e4re, aber auch Abteilungsleiter und in Einzelfragen andere Ministerialbeamte sowie in Einzelfragen unabh\\u00e4ngige Sachverst\\u00e4ndige z\\u00e4hlten, sollten wesentliche Entscheidungen vorbereiten bzw. weiter beraten und damit die Arbeit des Kabinetts wesentlich entlasten. Ihre Protokolle sind deshalb als direkte Erg\\u00e4nzung zu den Kabinettsberatungen zu sehen.\\nIm Fr\\u00fchjahr 1951 wurde der Kabinettausschuss f\\u00fcr Wirtschaft, im Sommer 1955 der Ministerausschuss f\\u00fcr die Sozialreform gegr\\u00fcndet.

Sie werden seit 1982 vom Bundesarchiv aufgrund des Auftrags der Bundesregierung aus dem Jahr 1979 als wissenschaftliche Edition zun\\u00e4chst in Buchform ver\\u00f6ffentlicht.Die Protokolltexte wurden bis 1998 als geheime Verschlusssache in der Registratur des Bundeskanzleramts verwahrt und nach der Abgabe an das Bundesarchiv dort dem Bestand Bundeskanzleramt (B\\u00a0136) zugeordnet. Die Mitschriften der Kabinettssitzungen sind bis zum Ende der 4. Wahlperiode im Herbst 1965 in zwei Serien - Entw\\u00fcrfe und Ausfertigungen - organisiert; die Sitzungsprotokolle des Kabinettsausschusses f\\u00fcr Wirtschaft sowie des Ministerausschusses f\\u00fcr die Sozialreform sind in einer einzigen Serie zusammengefasst.Die Edition pr\\u00e4sentiert den Text der Protokollausfertigungen in ungek\\u00fcrzter, aber im Layout aufbereiteter Form. Von den Ausfertigungen abweichende Entwurfsstadien wurden im Anmerkungsapparat nur dann nachgewiesen, wenn es inhaltlich angemessen erschien. Auch die der Entwurfsserie beigef\\u00fcgten Einladungen und deren Anlagen sowie das in die Protokollserien aufgenommenen Schriftst\\u00fccke sind von der Ver\\u00f6ffentlichung ausgenommen. Nachtr\\u00e4gliche Protokollkorrekturen - in der Regel dem ausgefertigten Protokoll als Anhang beigef\\u00fcgt - sind bei inhaltliche Relevanz dagegen ber\\u00fccksichtigt und die urspr\\u00fcnglichen Textfassungen der Ausfertigungen in den Anmerkungen nachgewiesen.F\\u00fcr die Jahre 1949 und 1950 enth\\u00e4lt die Entwurfsserie des Bundeskanzleramtes zus\\u00e4tzlich stenographische Mitschriften von sechs Kabinettssitzungen, die als Wortprotokolle innerhalb des ersten Jahresbandes 1949 bzw. f\\u00fcr 1950 in einem eigenen Band ver\\u00f6ffentlicht wurden.\\n\\u00dcbersicht \\u00fcber die Serien der Ausfertigungen der Kabinettsprotokolle im Bestand des Bundeskanzleramtes (B\\u00a0136)\\n            Kabinett 1949\\n            1.-32.

Juli 1960\\n            B\\u00a0136/36235\\u00a0TextaufbereitungF\\u00fcr alle Teile des Protokolltextes gilt ebenso wie f\\u00fcr Quellenzitate im Kommentar, dass offensichtliche orthographische oder syntaktische Fehler der Textvorlagen stillschweigend korrigiert wurden. In Zweifelsf\\u00e4llen sind die Korrekturen der Bearbeiter kenntlich gemacht. Dar\\u00fcber hinaus sind keine Vereinheitlichungen und Normalisierungen - auch nicht im Hinblick auf die seit 1998 f\\u00fcr den beh\\u00f6rdlichen Gebrauch eingef\\u00fchrten Rechtschreibregeln - vorgenommen worden.Die sprechenden Personen, die im Protokolltext der Vorlage in der Regel durch Unterstreichungen markiert wurden, sind ab dem Jahresband 1957 in der Edition im Kursivsatz wiedergegeben.\\u00a0ProtokollkopfDie Protokollteile \\u00dcberschrift, Teilnehmer sowie Zeit und Ort der Sitzungen wurden von den Bearbeitern gestaltet. Sie enthalten in einheitlicher und \\u00fcbersichtlicher Form die den Textvorlagen entnommenen Angaben. Dabei entspricht die Reihenfolge der genannten Teilnehmer der Vorlage, die sich wiederum hinsichtlich der Bundesminister nach der amtlichen Reihenfolge der Ministerien richtet. Bundesminister, Staatssekret\\u00e4re und andere Sitzungsteilnehmer sind durch Semikola voneinander abgetrennt. Soweit dies nicht bereits in den Vorlagen geschehen war, sind seit dem Jahresband 1957 bei der Nennung der Ministerialbeamten stillschweigend das entsendende Ressort, bei den sonstigen Sitzungsteilnehmern entsprechende Hinweise auf ihre Funktion hinzugef\\u00fcgt worden.\\u00a0Tagesordnung und TagesordnungspunkteBis zum Jahresband 1956 wurden die den Sitzungsprotokollen vorangestellten Tagesordnungen in den Editionsb\\u00e4nden nicht abgedruckt. F\\u00fcr die Jahresb\\u00e4nde ab 1957 bzw. f\\u00fcr die editierten Protokolle des Kabinettsausschusses f\\u00fcr Wirtschaft und des Ministerausschusses f\\u00fcr die Sozialreform sind sie auf der Grundlage der Protokollausfertigungen \\u00fcbernommen worden. Die Angaben zu den Kabinettsvorlagen einschlie\\u00dflich der Akten- bzw. Gesch\\u00e4ftszeichen stammen aus den Einladungsschreiben und sind gegebenenfalls ohne besondere Kennzeichnung von den Bearbeitern so weit wie erforderlich und m\\u00f6glich vervollst\\u00e4ndigt worden.Die Formulierung der Tagesordnungspunkte in den edierten Protokolltexten entspricht grunds\\u00e4tzlich dem Wortlaut der Vorlagen. Das f\\u00fcr den jeweiligen Tagesordnungspunkt federf\\u00fchrende Ressort wurde nach der \\u00dcberschrift dann angef\\u00fcgt, wenn dessen Nennung auch Bestandteil der Tagesordnung in den Textvorlagen war.Ordentliche Tagesordnungspunkte wurden in den Protokollausfertigungen in der Regel durchgehend nummeriert und sind in dieser Z\\u00e4hlung in die Edition \\u00fcbernommen worden. Au\\u00dferordentliche Tagesordnungspunkte waren dagegen in den Protokollvorlagen meistens nicht nummeriert. Um jedem Tagesordnungspunkt eine eindeutige Kennzeichnung zu geben, wurden deshalb in der Edition alle au\\u00dferhalb der Tagesordnung behandelten Punkte grunds\\u00e4tzlich mit fortlaufenden Gro\\u00dfbuchstaben in eckigen Klammern markiert. Ordentliche einzige Punkte der Tagesordnung sind in den edierten Protokolltexten im Interesse der Zitierf\\u00e4higkeit durch die Ziffer 1 in eckigen Klammern gekennzeichnet.Au\\u00dferhalb der ordentlichen Tagesordnung stehende und vom Protokollanten nicht eigens \\u00fcberschriebene Textpassagen sind durch die Bearbeiter zur besseren inhaltlichen \\u00dcberschaubarkeit mit \\u00dcberschriften versehen worden. Diese nachtr\\u00e4glich gebildeten \\u00dcberschriften sind durch eckige Klammern gekennzeichnet und werden, wie au\\u00dferordentliche Tagesordnungspunkte, mit Gro\\u00dfbuchstaben eingef\\u00fchrt.\\u00a0Parallel\\u00fcberlieferungenMit den Sitzungsmitschriften der Minister Hans-Christoph Seebohm und Hans-Joachim von Merkatz stehen Parallel\\u00fcberlieferungen zu den Kabinettsprotokollen zur Verf\\u00fcgung. Sie wurden, soweit sie aussagekr\\u00e4ftig sind, zur Kommentierung insbesondere jener Tagesordnungspunkte herangezogen, zu denen kein amtliches Protokoll vorliegt und zum Teil in den Protokolltext inseriert. Dies betrifft haupts\\u00e4chlich die auf die Bundesminister beschr\\u00e4nkten Sitzungsabschnitte. Weitere erg\\u00e4nzende Informationen zu Inhalt und Verlauf der Kabinettsberatungen sind den Mitschriften oder z.T. ausf\\u00fchrlichen Vermerken anderer Sitzungsteilnehmer zu entnehmen, wie z.\\u00a0B. von Bundesfinanzminister Sch\\u00e4ffer f\\u00fcr Staatsekret\\u00e4r Hartmann, von Staatssekret\\u00e4r Hallstein oder des Ministerialdirektors im Bundesministerium f\\u00fcr Angelegenheiten des Bundesrates und der L\\u00e4nder, Renatus Weber.\\u00a0Kommentierung\\u00a0KommentarDer in den Anmerkungen pr\\u00e4sentierte Kommentar zu den Protokolltexten verfolgt mehrere Ziele. Neben der textkritischen Beschreibung des Textkorpus dienen die Anmerkungen zun\\u00e4chst dazu, den Protokolltext verst\\u00e4ndlich zu machen und an den Beratungsgegenstand heranzuf\\u00fchren. Nicht allgemein bekannte Ereignisse und Institutionen sowie heute ungebr\\u00e4uchliche Begriffe werden bei ihrer ersten Erw\\u00e4hnung erl\\u00e4utert. Im Protokolltext erw\\u00e4hnte Besprechungen, Schreiben, Vermerke, Gesetzestexte, Drucksachen, Zeitungsartikel usw. werden verifiziert und deren Fundstellen dokumentiert. Insbesondere ist beabsichtigt, die zu den Beratungsgegenst\\u00e4nden entstandene und im Bundesarchiv, aber auch in anderen Archiven verwahrte archivische \\u00dcberlieferung so weit m\\u00f6glich nachzuweisen. Vor allem gilt das f\\u00fcr die den Kabinettsberatungen zu Grunde liegenden Kabinettsvorlagen, die in den Best\\u00e4nden des jeweils federf\\u00fchrenden Ressorts im Bundesarchiv oder im Politischen Archiv des Ausw\\u00e4rtigen Amts bzw. auch im Bestand Bundeskanzleramt im Bundesarchiv \\u00fcberliefert sind. Dar\\u00fcber hinaus soll dem Benutzer der Edition durch die Bezeichnung weiterer Unterlagen der zust\\u00e4ndigen und qualifiziert beteiligten Ressorts der gezielte Einstieg in die einschl\\u00e4gige Sachakten\\u00fcberlieferung erm\\u00f6glicht werden. Auch auf Unterlagen in den verf\\u00fcgbaren Nachl\\u00e4ssen von Kabinettsmitgliedern im Bundesarchiv und in den Parteiarchiven wird gegebenenfalls hingewiesen.Die als Hyperlinks erkennbaren R\\u00fcckverweise, Fortg\\u00e4nge und Querverweise lassen im Kommentar den Verlauf der Beratungen einer Angelegenheit sowohl im Kabinett als gegebenenfalls auch im Kabinettsausschuss f\\u00fcr Wirtschaft bzw. im Ministerausschuss f\\u00fcr die Sozialreform nachvollziehbar werden. Gleiches gilt f\\u00fcr die Beratungen in den Aussch\\u00fcssen.Hinsichtlich der im Kabinett besprochenen Gesetz- oder Verordnungsentw\\u00fcrfe wird auf die Nachzeichnung der sich an den Kabinettsbeschluss anschlie\\u00dfenden parlamentarischen Behandlung verzichtet, sofern die Angelegenheit nicht wieder aus den Gesetzgebungsk\\u00f6rperschaften ins Kabinett zur\\u00fcckkam. Nachgewiesen werden in jedem Fall die betreffenden Drucksachen des Bundesrats und des Bundestags und zwar mit den Nummern, welche die Regierungsvorlagen jeweils f\\u00fcr die erste Behandlung dort erhielten. Abgeschlossen wird die Kommentierung mit dem Hinweis auf die amtliche Ver\\u00f6ffentlichung von Gesetzen, Verordnungen, Regierungsabkommen, Beschl\\u00fcssen oder Verlautbarungen. Wissenschaftliche Literatur wird nur dann angegeben, wenn der Sachkommentar dadurch wesentlich entlastet werden kann. Die im Kommentar verwendeten Kurztitel sind im jeweiligen Quellen- und Literaturverzeichnis aufgel\\u00f6st.\\u00a0Biographische AngabenAlle in den Dokumentenk\\u00f6pfen aufgef\\u00fchrten Sitzungsteilnehmer sind mit biographischen Angaben, insbesondere zum beruflichen Werdegang, in einer besonderen Zusammenstellung im Navigationsbaum unter dem Auswahlpunkt \\u203aPersonen\\u2039 aufgef\\u00fchrt. Sonstige im Protokolltext namentlich genannte Personen erhalten bei ihrer ersten Nennung eine biographische Anmerkung.F\\u00fcr die Jahresb\\u00e4nde 1949 bis 1956 umfasst die Auflistung nur die in der Gesch\\u00e4ftsordnung der Bundesregierung bestimmten regelm\\u00e4\\u00dfigen Sitzungsteilnehmer. Die \\u00fcbrigen Teilnehmer werden, wie auch die sonstigen namentlich genannten Personen, bei ihrer ersten Nennung mit einer biographischen Anmerkung versehen.\\u00a0PersonalienSind bei den Kabinettsberatungen zu Personalsachen Namen nur den Anlagen zu entnehmen, so beschreibt der Kommentar zusammenfassend, welche und wie viele Positionen in den jeweiligen Ministerien und deren Gesch\\u00e4ftsbereich besetzt werden sollten. Erst ab der Besetzung von Abteilungsleiterstellen in einem Ministerium (Ministerialdirektoren, gelegentlich auch Ministerialdirigenten) und von ausw\\u00e4rtigen Vertretungen (einschlie\\u00dflich Konsulaten) sowie ab der Ernennung von Brigadegeneralen, von Bundesrichtern, Oberfinanz- und Senatspr\\u00e4sidenten, Pr\\u00e4sidenten von Landesarbeits\\u00e4mtern, Bundesbahn- und Oberpostdirektionen und anderen Leitern, im allgemeinen auch stellvertretenden Leitern von Bundesbeh\\u00f6rden wurden die im Protokoll nicht genannten Namen aus den (nicht abgedruckten) Anlagen in die Anmerkungen \\u00fcbernommen.\\u00a0Weitere Teile der EditionDie in jedem Editionsband den Protokolltexten\\n        vorangestellte Einleitung ordnet die Kabinettsberatungen in den\\n        allgemeinen ereignisgeschichtlichen Rahmen des jeweiligen Jahres ein und\\n        gibt eine sachliche Einf\\u00fchrung zu den im Kabinett behandelten Themen.

Oldenbourg Verlag M\\u00fcnchen 2002ISBN 978-3-486-56566-9\\nDer sowjetische Vorschlag einer Gipfelkonferenz und das Berlin-Ultimatum Chruschtschows bildeten vor dem Hintergrund des sich versch\\u00e4rfenden Ost-West-Konflikts im Jahre 1958 den Rahmen f\\u00fcr die Bem\\u00fchungen der Bundesregierung um eine L\\u00f6sung der deutschen Frage. Gleichzeitig kennzeichneten der Aufbau der europ\\u00e4ischen Institutionen und die wachsenden Verpflichtungen der Bundesrepublik im westlichen Verteidigungsb\\u00fcndnis den fortschreitenden Prozess ihrer Westintegration. Dazu geh\\u00f6rten auch die Bestrebungen der Bundesregierung, einen Ausgleich in den durch die Ereignisse des Zweiten Weltkrieges immer noch belasteten Beziehungen zu den westlichen Nachbarstaaten zu finden. In diesem Zusammenhang ist besonders die deutsch-franz\\u00f6sische Ann\\u00e4herung zu nennen, die durch pers\\u00f6nliche Begegnungen Adenauers mit dem neuen franz\\u00f6sischen Ministerpr\\u00e4sidenten de Gaulle in Colombey-les-deux-Eglises und Bad Kreuznach eingeleitet wurde. Zu den innenpolitisch vorherrschenden Themen dieses Jahres z\\u00e4hlte die Auseinandersetzung um die Frage der atomaren Aufr\\u00fcstung der Bundeswehr, die in der Anti-Atomtod-Bewegung ihren deutlichen Ausdruck fand. Unruhe in der Bev\\u00f6lkerung verursachte auch die Kohlenkrise, die die Bundesregierung durch ein B\\u00fcndel von Ma\\u00dfnahmen einzud\\u00e4mmen suchte. Daneben nahm sie umfangreiche Reformvorhaben in Angriff, die u. a. das Steuer- und Aktienrecht, die Notstands- und Parteiengesetzgebung, das Rundfunkwesen und die soziale Krankenversicherung betrafen.\"}\n",

Die Online-Version der edierten Kabinettsprotokolle steht seit 2003 im Internet bereit. Sie macht die f\\u00fcr die Erforschung der Geschichte der Bundesrepublik Deutschland zentrale Quelle der Kabinettsprotokolle einem deutlich breiteren Benutzerkreis zug\\u00e4nglich. Ihr entscheidender Mehrwert liegt in der Erleichterung und Erweiterung der Recherchem\\u00f6glichkeiten. Neben gezielter Suche und raschem Zugriff auch auf detaillierte Informationen erm\\u00f6glicht sie mittels kombinierter Suchstrategien auch Abfragen komplexer Sachverhalte sowie neue Methoden und Wege der Textauswertung. Gleichzeitig erleichtert sie durch ein Navigationssystem die Orientierung in einem immer umfangreicher werdenden Text. Ferner ist die digitale Version besonders dazu geeignet, das im Editionskonzept enthaltene System von Vor- und R\\u00fcckverweisen zu unterst\\u00fctzen. Eine Verlinkung der einzelnen Tagesordnungspunkte untereinander erlaubt es, den Beratungsverlauf im Kabinett und in seinen Aussch\\u00fcssen auch \\u00fcber die tradierten Band- und Jahresgrenzen hinaus im gesamten anwachsenden Corpus der Protokolltexte zu verfolgen.\\nNicht zuletzt besteht der Gewinn einer Internet-Version der Edition darin, die Quellenangaben in den Kommentaren der Kabinettsprotokolle mit den Bestands\\u00fcbersichten des Bundesarchivs zu verkn\\u00fcpfen. Mit diesem Zugang zu anderen, teilweise erst im Aufbau befindlichen Online-Dienstleistungen entspricht das Bundesarchiv auch der Zielsetzung der Bundesregierung, alle internetf\\u00e4higen Dienstleistungen der Bundesverwaltung online bereitzustellen.\\nDer wesentliche Vorteil der digitalen Version der Edition ist die Mehrdimensionalit\\u00e4t des Zugriffs. Die weiterhin im Buchdruck erscheinende Version des Editionswerks, die sequentielles Lesen erm\\u00f6glicht und Zitierbarkeit auch in klassischer Form sicherstellt, beh\\u00e4lt daneben ihre Berechtigung.\\nIn Erg\\u00e4nzung des wissenschaftlichen Editionswerks in seiner gedruckten und seiner digitalen Form konnte nach der erforderlichen Anpassung der rechtlichen Rahmenbedingungen das Bundesarchiv 2013 auf der vorliegenden Internet-Seite in einem Zuge diejenigen bereits schutzfristfreien 13 Jahrg\\u00e4nge der Kabinettsprotokolle der \\u00d6ffentlichkeit pr\\u00e4sentieren, zu denen bis dahin noch kein editorischer Sachkommentar erstellt worden war. Seitdem werden diese insoweit noch unkommentierten, jedoch schon textkritisch bearbeiteten Protokolle kontinuierlich entlang der archivrechtlichen 30-Jahresschutzfrist jahrgangsweise erg\\u00e4nzt. Sie sind in klarer Abgrenzung von den bereits abschlie\\u00dfend kommentierten Protokolljahrg\\u00e4ngen auf der Ebene der einzelnen Tagesordnungspunkte entsprechend gekennzeichnet, und sie bleiben als \\u00dcbergangsangebot jeweils nur solange im Internet eingestellt, bis sie durch die einschl\\u00e4gigen Jahrg\\u00e4nge der Online-Version der Edition nach deren Abschluss ersetzt werden k\\u00f6nnen.\"}\n",

Auf diese bedrohliche zugespitzte Situation reagierte die Bundesregierung u.a. mit einer vor\\u00fcbergehenden Verst\\u00e4rkung der Bundeswehr. Diese Ereignisse stellten gleichzeitig den deutschlandpolitischen Kurs von Bundeskanzler Adenauer in Frage, dessen Autorit\\u00e4t durch den Verlust der absoluten Mehrheit bei den Bundestagswahlen im September 1961 zus\\u00e4tzlich ersch\\u00fcttert wurde.

Die neue Bundesregierung unter Bundeskanzler Helmut Schmidt führt die bisherige Ost- und Deutschlandpolitik fort und bemüht sich gleichermaßen um eine Intensivierung der transatlantischen Beziehungen. Die mit der Ölkrise 1973/74 einhergehende wirtschaftliche Rezession erschwert die Umsetzung der innenpolitischen Reformvorhaben. Angesichts der begrenzten Energieressourcen gewinnen Pläne zur Kernkraftnutzung zusätzlichen Auftrieb. Zur Abstimmung gemeinsamer politischer Ziele beschließen die Staats- und Regierungschefs der Europäischen Gemeinschaften auf der Gipfelkonferenz in Paris regelmäßig mit den Außenministern als Rat der Gemeinschaft (ab 1992 Europäischer Rat) zusammenzutreten. Ferner berät das Kabinett organisatorische Fragen und Sicherheitsmaßnahmen für die in München stattfindende Fußballweltmeisterschaft, bei der die deutsche Mannschaft zum zweiten Mal den Titel erringt.'],\n",

              "  'Kabinett\\nAuf der Grundlage des 1979 von der Bundesregierung dem Bundesarchiv erteilten Auftrags, die Kabinettsprotokolle der Bundesregierung in wissenschaftlicher Form zu veröffentlichen, hat sich inzwischen eine vielbändige Editionsreihe entwickelt.\\nAngesichts dieser auch weiterhin anwachsenden Informationsfülle lag es nahe, die Informationstechnik für die Erschließung der Texte zu nutzen. Die Online-Version der edierten Kabinettsprotokolle steht seit 2003 im Internet bereit. Sie macht die für die Erforschung der Geschichte der Bundesrepublik Deutschland zentrale Quelle der Kabinettsprotokolle einem deutlich breiteren Benutzerkreis zugänglich. Ihr entscheidender Mehrwert liegt in der Erleichterung und Erweiterung der Recherchemöglichkeiten. Neben gezielter Suche und raschem Zugriff auch auf detaillierte Informationen ermöglicht sie mittels kombinierter Suchstrategien auch Abfragen komplexer Sachverhalte sowie neue Methoden und Wege der Textauswertung. Gleichzeitig erleichtert sie durch ein Navigationssystem die Orientierung in einem immer umfangreicher werdenden Text. Ferner ist die digitale Version besonders dazu geeignet, das im Editionskonzept enthaltene System von Vor- und Rückverweisen zu unterstützen. Eine Verlinkung der einzelnen Tagesordnungspunkte untereinander erlaubt es, den Beratungsverlauf im Kabinett und in seinen Ausschüssen auch über die tradierten Band- und Jahresgrenzen hinaus im gesamten anwachsenden Corpus der Protokolltexte zu verfolgen.\\nNicht zuletzt besteht der Gewinn einer Internet-Version der Edition darin, die Quellenangaben in den Kommentaren der Kabinettsprotokolle mit den Bestandsübersichten des Bundesarchivs zu verknüpfen. Mit diesem Zugang zu anderen, teilweise erst im Aufbau befindlichen Online-Dienstleistungen entspricht das Bundesarchiv auch der Zielsetzung der Bundesregierung, alle internetfähigen Dienstleistungen der Bundesverwaltung online bereitzustellen.\\nDer wesentliche Vorteil der digitalen Version der Edition ist die Mehrdimensionalität des Zugriffs. Die weiterhin im Buchdruck erscheinende Version des Editionswerks, die sequentielles Lesen ermöglicht und Zitierbarkeit auch in klassischer Form sicherstellt, behält daneben ihre Berechtigung.\\nIn Ergänzung des wissenschaftlichen Editionswerks in seiner gedruckten und seiner digitalen Form konnte nach der erforderlichen Anpassung der rechtlichen Rahmenbedingungen das Bundesarchiv 2013 auf der vorliegenden Internet-Seite in einem Zuge diejenigen bereits schutzfristfreien 13 Jahrgänge der Kabinettsprotokolle der Öffentlichkeit präsentieren, zu denen bis dahin noch kein editorischer Sachkommentar erstellt worden war. Seitdem werden diese insoweit noch unkommentierten, jedoch schon textkritisch bearbeiteten Protokolle kontinuierlich entlang der archivrechtlichen 30-Jahresschutzfrist jahrgangsweise ergänzt. Sie sind in klarer Abgrenzung von den bereits abschließend kommentierten Protokolljahrgängen auf der Ebene der einzelnen Tagesordnungspunkte entsprechend gekennzeichnet, und sie bleiben als Übergangsangebot jeweils nur solange im Internet eingestellt, bis sie durch die einschlägigen Jahrgänge der Online-Version der Edition nach deren Abschluss ersetzt werden können.'],\n",

Oldenbourg Verlag München 2003ISBN 3-486-56753-5\\nEinen Schwerpunkt der Kabinettsberatungen des Jahres 1960 bildet neben der Frage eines beschleunigten Ausbaus der EWG weiterhin die Berlin-Krise, die sich nach dem Scheitern der Pariser Gipfelkonferenz im Mai erneut verschärft. Repressalien der DDR im Reiseverkehr beantwortet die Bundesrepublik mit der Kündigung des Interzonenhandelsabkommens. Ausführlich dokumentiert ist auf innenpolitischem Gebiet insbesondere die heftige Auseinandersetzung mit den Ländern um das zweite Fernsehprogramm. 15 Jahre nach Kriegsende rückt ferner als Folge der antisemitischen Vorfälle der Jahreswende 1959/1960 erstmals der Umgang mit der nationalsozialistischen Vergangenheit in das Blickfeld des Kabinetts. Die wirtschaftliche Lage ist gekennzeichnet durch eine anhaltende Hochkonjunktur und ein weiteres Absinken der Arbeitslosigkeit. Der Bundeshaushalt überschreitet erstmals die 40 Milliarden-Grenze. Vor dem Hintergrund von Konzentrationserscheinungen in der Wirtschaft führt die Bundesregierung Maßnahmen zur Eigentumsbildung breiter Schichten wie die Privatisierung des Volkswagenwerkes und das Vermögensbildungsgesetz sowie zur Förderung des Mittelstandes fort.'],\n",

Jeder dieser Funktionsbereiche ist als eigene Seite realisiert und gegliedert. Ein allgemeine Funktion in der Utility-Leiste am oberen Bildschirmrand enthält die  Hilfeseiten und das Impressum.\\nUnter der Rubrik „Edition“ sind alle Bände der Edition (Kabinettsprotokolle und Kabinettsauschüsse), die Kurzbiographien, die Netzeditionsgrundsätze und die Geschäftsordnung der Bundesregierung mit einem gemeinsamen Inhaltsverzeichnis versammelt. Das Inhaltsverzeichnis der Edition und des jeweils ausgewählten Bandes bzw. Teilbereichs ist hier abrufbar. Aus dem Inhaltsverzeichnis heraus kann das jeweilige Dokument oder der Tagesordnungspunkt aufgerufen werden. Dies bewirkt einen Wechsel in den Band.\\n\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\nnach oben\\n\\xa0SeitenaufbauJede Seite ist in mehrere Teilbereiche unterteilt:\\nTextFunktionenNavigationsbaumNavigationsmenüServicelinksBandbilderStandortLayoutmenuUtility-LeisteDiese Bereiche kehren auf jeder Seite wieder und werden in der Darstellung für Screenreader durch Zwischenüberschriften besonders hervorgehoben. Dies kann durch eine „Textansicht“ ebenfalls erreicht werden. Diese Ansicht bewirkt das Abschalten der visuellen Formatierungen und wird in geeigneten Browsern, wie Firefox, Mozilla und Opera, durch den Befehl „Ansicht > Webseiten-Stil > Kein Stil“ bzw. „Ansicht > Stil > Nutzer-Modus“ erreicht.\\n\\nnach oben\\n\\xa0Beschreibung der Teilbereiche einer SeiteMit der Bezeichnung „Text“ ist der Protokolltext bzw. das Inhaltsverzeichnis als Hauptinhalt der Seite benannt.Mit „Funktionen“ ist die Auswahl zwischen Edition und Suche gemeint. „Suche“ steht dabei für das Suchformular, „Edition für das Inhaltsverzeichnis aller verfügbaren Bände. „Navigationsmenü“ ist die Bezeichnung für das Blättern in den Bänden. Hier können die im Buch vorgehenden und nachfolgenden Textabschnitte ausgewählt werden, aber auch der vorige oder nächste Abschnitt gleicher Art. Ebenso ist das Inhaltsverzeichnis stets erreichbar sowie der Anfang und das Ende des Textes auf der aktuellen Seite. Das Navigationsmenü ist mit Access-Keys hinterlegt, die im Folgenden beschrieben werden. Das Navigationsmenü kann wahlweise ein- oder ausgeblendet werden. „Navigationsbaum“ bezeichnet die Darstellung des Inhaltsverzeichnisses sowie der Unterpunkte in Form einer Hierarchie. Ein Abschnitt mit Unterpunkten bildet einen Knoten. Unter Knoten sind die Inhaltseinheiten zu verstehen, Unterpunkte können die Tagesordnungspunkte eines Protokolls sein, oder die Protokolle eines Bandes.„Servicelinks“ sind Links auf allgemeine Seiten des Bundesarchivs, die aus der Online-Edition herausführen.„Bandbilder“ sind jeweils fünf Bilder, die aus der gedruckten Edition entnommen wurden und jeweils zu einem Band eingeblendet werden. Die Bilder sind mit einem alternativen Text beschrieben.„Standort“ stellt den Weg vom Anfangspunkt der Edition, über die gewählte Serie, den aktuellen Band und Abschnitt darin zum angezeigten Textabschnitt  . Die jeweils übergeordneten Texteinheiten sind durch Links erreichbar. Innerhalb eines Bandes wird mit dem Wort „Standort“ im Navigationsbaum die Position im Inhaltsverzeichnis markiert.Das „Layoutmenü“ ermöglicht die Wahl der Darstellung. Die Fußnoten können entweder hinter jedem Absatz oder am Ende der Seite angezeigt werden. Der Text kann kontrastreduziert sowohl in schwarz auf weißem Grund  als auch in weiß auf schwarzem Grund angezeigt werden. Das Inhaltsverzeichnis kann ausgeblendet werden, die Funktionen „Suche“, „Inhaltsverzeichnis der Edition“ und „Hilfe“ werden nicht ausgeblendet und über das Layoutmenü kann das Inhaltsverzeichnis auch wieder eingeschaltet werden.\\nnach oben\\n\\xa0Access KeysDie Links auf die Funktionen der Seite können mit Abkürzungen (sog.

Zur leichteren Orientierung wird in der ersten Überschrift der Bezeichner für die Position im aktuellen Band und der inhaltliche Titel der Seite genannt. Diese Information geht auch aus dem HTML-Titel der Seite und der Adresse der Seite hervor. Die Bandangabe ist auch ein Teil der Adresse jeder Seite.Es folgen Kurzverweise „Zum Text“, „Zum Suchformular“, „Zu den Funktionen“ und „Zum Navigationsmenü“. Auf Seiten, die Fußnoten enthalten, kann die erste Fußnote direkt angesteuert werden. Auf Seiten, die aus einer Suche aufgerufen wurden, kann der erste Suchtreffer direkt angesteuert werden. Dann folgen hinter „Springe direkt zu:“ die Verweise auf die wiederkehrenden Bereiche jeder Seite.Die wiederkehrenden Bereiche werden durch Überschriften eingeleitet, die zur Strukturierung der Seite dargestellt werden. Der Text der beschriebenen abkürzenden Links und die strukturierenden Überschriften sind nicht Teil der Edition. Nur der Abschnitt zwischen den Überschriften „Text“ und „Extras (Fußzeile)“ auf den Seiten eines Bandes entstammt der Edition.\\n\\n\\nnach oben\\n\\xa0BilderBilder werden regelmäßig in der Bildleiste zu jedem Band eingeblendet und treten vereinzelt im Text der Edition auf. Alle Bilder der Bildleiste sind der Buchedition entnommen und durch einen alternativen Text beschrieben. Die Beschreibung der Bilder war in der gedruckten Fassung der Edition nicht in jedem Fall enthalten. Die Bildbeschreibung wird als alternativer Link auf eine Seite „longdesc.html“ angegeben und anstelle des Bildes eingeblendet. Wird in der Bildbeschreibung auf Tagesordnungspunkte verwiesen, sind diese durch einen Link erreichbar.\\nAbbildungen im Text, die in schwarz auf weißem Grund vorliegen, werden in der invertierten Darstellung einer Seite ebenfalls invertiert dargestellt.\\n\\n\\nnach oben\\n\\xa0TabellenZur Formatierung des Textes werden Tabellen nur dann eingesetzt, wenn ihr Inhalt ohne Sinnentstellung hintereinander lesbar ist. Die Darstellung tabellarischer Inhalte wurde durch die Vergabe von Spalten- und Zeilenüberschriften verbessert. Eine Zusammenfassung des Inhalts wurde für die Online-Edition ebenfalls ergänzt, auch sie ist kein Bestandteil der gedruckten Fassung.\\nnach oben\\n\\xa0Suche in den Kabinettsprotokollen\\xa01. KurzfassungAllgemeines zur Volltextsuche:Durch einen Klick auf den Schriftzug »Suche« öffnen Sie die Recherchemaske am linken Bildrand. Jetzt haben Sie die Möglichkeit zu einer Volltextsuche, d.h., Sie können nach einzelnen Wörtern (z.B. »Gipfelkonferenz«) oder nach längeren Textpassagen suchen (z.B. »Anhebung der Verkehrstarife«). Findet die Suchmaschine das von Ihnen eingegebene Wort bzw. die Wörter, so erscheinen im mittleren Teil der Seite die erzielten Treffer. Die Trefferdarstellung verwendet Zwischenüberschriften, welche die Zugehörigkeit der Treffer zu einem Band bzw. Bandtyp markieren. Bei bandübergreifender Recherche erfolgt eine chronologische Darstellung. Die Treffer erscheinen in der Abfolge der Strukturteile eines Bandes; innerhalb der Protokolltexte sind sie chronologisch angeordnet. Sollten mehr als die eingestellten anzuzeigenden Treffer gefunden worden sein, wird unterhalb der Bandbilder und am Fuß der Seite am rechten Rand eine Navigationshilfe für die Trefferseiten eingeblendet.Die gefundenen Treffer werden als Links erstellt. Wenn Sie auf einen Treffer klicken, wird das Hauptfenster aktualisiert. Dort erscheint der erste Absatz, in dem das gesuchte Wort bzw. die gesuchten Wörter gefunden wurden. In der Navigationshilfe auf der linken Seite und in der Standortleiste unterhalb der Bandbilder ist die entsprechende Stelle markiert, die das aktualisierte Textelement im gesamten Textcorpus einnimmt. Das Suchwort bzw. die Suchwörter werden gelb hervorgehoben. Bei mehreren Suchtreffern auf einer Seite ist ein Treffer jeweils mit dem nächsten Absatz verlinkt, der den Folgetreffer enthält.\\nnach oben\\n\\xa02. LangfassungUm möglichst wenige und genaue Treffer zu erhalten, gibt es eine Vielzahl von Einschränkungsmöglichkeiten, die miteinander kombiniert werden können.\\xa0a) Suche mit Booleschen OperatorenUm Ihre Suche stärker einzuschränken, können Sie mehrere Suchbegriffe gleichzeitig eingeben und diese auf verschiedene Weise miteinander verknüpfen. Dabei gibt es folgende Verknüpfungsmöglichkeiten:\\n1. »AND«: Dies ist die Standardverknüpfung. Geben Sie mehrere Begriffe in die Suchmaske ein, werden diese automatisch mit »AND« verknüpft. Bei dieser Verknüpfung werden Ihnen nur diejenigen Textstellen angezeigt, in denen beide Begriffe vorkommen. Geben Sie dazu ein »Anhebung AND Verkehrstarife«.2. »OR«: Wenn Sie z.B. die Begriffe »Anhebung« und »Verkehrstarife« eingeben, dann erhalten Sie alle Textstellen, in denen entweder das eine oder das andere Wort oder beide Wörter zusammen vorkommen.3. »NOT«: Durch diesen Operator können Sie Wörter ausschließen. Wenn Sie »Adenauer NOT Erhard« eingeben, so erhalten Sie nur Textstellen in denen der Begriff Adenauer vorkommt, Erhard aber nicht.4. »+«: Setzen Sie dieses Zeichen vor dasjenige Wort, das auf jeden Fall vorkommen soll. Wenn Sie z.B. eingeben »Anhebung +Verkehrstarife«, so erhalten Sie alle Textstellen angezeigt, in denen der Begriff »Verkehrstarife« vorkommt, jedoch nicht zwingend der Begriff »Anhebung«.5. Wildcard-Suche: Sucht alle Varianten eines Wortes; geben Sie z.B. »Verkehr*« ein, so erhalten Sie alle Textstellen, in denen Wörter mit dem Anfangsbestandteil Verkehr auftauchen.6. Phrase-Suche: Sucht eine genaue Abfolge von Worten. Geben Sie z.B. »\"Kampf dem Atomtod\"« (mit Anführungszeichen) ein, so erhalten Sie alle Textstellen, in denen diese drei Wörter in dieser Reihenfolge vorkommen.\\xa0b) Suche mit und ohne BegriffsbearbeitungIm Standardmodus wird die Suche mit »gleicher Wortstamm« durchgeführt, d.h., wenn Sie nach einem Wort in der Grundform suchen, werden auch Varianten mit abweichenden Endungen oder Pluralformen berücksichtigt. Suchen Sie den Begriff »Land« mit gleichem Wortstamm, finden Sie auch die Wörter »Landes« und »Länder«. Sollten Sie diese Suchfunktion nicht wünschen, können Sie im Menü Begriffsbearbeitung die Suche »genaue Treffer« wählen.\\xa0c) Auswahl Protokolle/BiographienIm der Standardeinstellung werden sowohl die Bände der Kabinettsprotokolle, der Kabinettsausschüsse als auch die bandübergreifenden Kurzbiographien abgesucht. Sind Sie an einer Suche in nur einem dieser Bereiche interessiert, können Sie diese über das Menüfenster entsprechend einschränken.\\xa0d) ZeitraumIm Standardmodus werden alle Bände seit 1949 bis zum aktuellsten durchsucht. Eine chronologische Einschränkung erfordert das Ausfüllen beider Jahresfelder in der »von-bis-Suche«.\\xa0e) Einschränkung der SuchgebieteIn der Standardeinstellung (Volltext) wird in allen Elementen der Edition der Kabinettsprotokolle nach den eingegebenen Begriffen gesucht. Wenn Sie beispielsweise das Wort »Oberländer« eingeben, so erhalten Sie z.B. Trefferanzeigen sowohl aus den Listen der Sitzungsteilnehmer, aus einzelnen Tagesordnungspunkten und aus der Einleitung.Sie können jedoch auch individuell festlegen, welche Bereiche im Text bei Ihrer Suche berücksichtigt werden sollen. Im Menü »Suchbereich« können Sie folgende Auswahl treffen:1. Volltext: Dies ist die Standardeinstellung. Alle Elemente werden bei der Suche berücksichtigt.2. Fußnoten: Nur die Fußnoten werden durchsucht.3. Teilnehmer: Nur die Teilnehmerlisten in den Dokumentenköpfen der einzelnen Sitzungen werden durchsucht.4. TOP-Überschrift: Nur die Überschriften der einzelnen Tagesordnungspunkte werden bei der Suche berücksichtigt.5. Protokolltext: Nur die reinen Protokolltexte werden durchsucht. In Bänden mit Wortprotokollen schließt das diese ein.6. Einleitung: Nur die Einleitungen werden durchsucht.\\xa0f) Suche über PersonenlisteJeder Band enthält den Auswahlpunkt »Personenliste«, über den Sie alle in dem betreffenden Band in der ein oder anderen Weise vorkommenden Personen ermitteln können. Klicken Sie in der A-Z-Liste auf einen Namen, so wird eine Suche nach dem Namen der betreffenden Person in der Eingrenzung auf den Band ausgelöst.\\nnach oben\\n\\xa0Suche in der barrierefreien VersionDie Suche in der barrierefreien Version entspricht der oben beschriebenen Suche.Am Anfang jeder Seite gibt es einen abkürzenden Link direkt „Zum Suchformular“. Die Felder des Suchformulars sind durch Drücken der „Tab“-Taste in der Reihenfolge nach auswählbar.\\xa0SuchergebnisseEine Suche stellt die Ergebnisse im Text-Bereich der Seite dar. Dort sind die Überschriften der Seiten mit Suchtreffern eingeblendet und verweisen auf die jeweilige Seite. Ebenfalls wird die Gesamtzahl der Suchtreffer angegeben und in welchem Block man sich befindet. Wurden mehr Seiten als in einem Block darstellbar gefunden, werden durchnumerierte Links zu den Folgeblöcken mit Suchtreffern als Navigationsmenü  angeboten. Sie sind auch über die Accesskeys wie folgt zu erreichen;6zur nächsten Block mit Treffern4zur vorhergehenden Block mit Treffern0zum Anfang des Textes, hier die Liste der Treffer, die durch die Überschrift des Textteils dargestellt sind.\\xa0Treffer auf der ErgebnisseiteBei Aktivierung eines Suchtreffers wird die jeweilige Seite aufgerufen. Am Anfang der Ergebnisseite wird ein weiterer Link eingeblendet, der auf den Absatz mit dem ersten Vorkommen des gesuchten Textes verweist. Im Titel dieses Links wird die Gesamtzahl der Absätze mit Vorkommen des gesuchten Textes auf der Ergebnisseite angegeben. Von jedem Suchtreffer kann man auf den Anfang des nächsten Absatzes springen, der Suchtreffer enthält. Dadurch wird der Fokus auf den Anfang des Kontextes gesetzt, in dem der gesuchte Text auftritt.Zusätzlich werden alle Suchtreffer auf einer Seite visuell durch einen gelben Hintergrund hervorgehoben.Auf die nächste Seite mit Treffern gelangt man durch Zurückgehen auf die Seite mit den Suchergebnissen. Dort ist die letzte Suche gespeichert und die nächste Seite mit Suchtreffern kann gewählt werden.\\nnach oben'],\n",

Oldenbourg Verlag München 2002ISBN 978-3-486-56699-4\\nIm zehnten Jahr des Bestehens der Bundesrepublik Deutschland standen im Mittelpunkt der außenpolitischen Tagesordnungspunkte des Kabinetts insbesondere die Berlin-Krise, die Deutschlandfrage und damit eng verknüpft die Genfer Außenministerkonferenz der vier Siegermächte. An diesen ergebnislos endenden Beratungen über die Zukunft Deutschlands nahmen erstmals Vertreter beider Teile Deutschlands am berühmt gewordenen „Katzentisch“ teil. Zu wichtigen innenpolitischen Themen des Kabinetts gehörten u. a. die Auseinandersetzungen mit den Bundesländern um die Einrichtung eines zweiten Fernsehsenders, die Parteiengesetzgebung, die Neuordnung der sozialen Krankenversicherung, die Kriegsopferversorgung, die Ausgabe erster Volksaktien, der Abschluss der wirtschaftlichen Eingliederung des Saarlandes sowie die Wahl des zweiten Bundespräsidenten Heinrich Lübke. Die Protokolle wiederspiegeln zudem die Auseinandersetzungen innerhalb der Bundesregierung über den Umgang mit der neuen Flagge der DDR, die aus Anlass des zehnten Jahrestages ihrer Gründung erstmals mit hinzugefügtem Staatswappen gehisst wurde und den Alleinvertretungsanspruch der Bundesrepublik in Frage stellte. Trotz allgemeiner positiver Konjunkturbilanz mit einer heute unvorstellbar niedrigen Arbeitslosenquote von 2,6 % war die Bundesregierung wegen der anhaltenden Absatzkrise im Steinkohlenbergbau und der Preissteigerungen für landwirtschaftliche Produkte zu eingreifenden Maßnahmen gezwungen. In einer großen Debatte des Bundestages über die Justizpolitik und im Fall des Bundesvertriebenenministers Oberländer hatte sich die Bundesregierung auch verstärkt mit dem Problem der nationalsozialistischen Vergangenheit auseinanderzusetzen.'],\n",

Oldenbourg Verlag München 2011ISBN 978-3-486-70518-8\\nDie erste Große Koalition sah sich 1968 mit heftigen, überwiegend studentischen Protesten gegen die gleichwohl verabschiedete Notstandsverfassung, den Vietnamkrieg und den Bildungsnotstand konfrontiert. Die Einführung der Pass- und Visumpflicht durch die DDR im innerdeutschen und Berlin-Verkehr und das militärische Eingreifen der Sowjetunion in der Tschechoslowakei belasteten die auf Entspannung ausgerichtete Deutschland- und Ostpolitik sowie die Sicherheits- und Bündnispolitik. Neben Fragen der bevorstehenden Unterzeichnung des Atomwaffensperrvertrags und einer künftigen politischen Erweiterung der Europäischen Gemeinschaften beriet das Kabinett über innenpolitisch bedeutende Reformvorhaben in der Rechts-,  Finanz-, Verkehrs- und Agrarpolitik sowie über die erstmaligen Berichte der Bundesregierung zur Lage der Familien und zur elektronischen Datenverarbeitung.'],\n",

Oldenbourg Verlag München 2009ISBN 978-3-486-58960-3\\nDer Luxemburger EWG-Kompromiss und Frankreichs Austritt aus den Kommandostrukturen der NATO sowie die Forderungen Großbritanniens und der USA nach vollem Devisenausgleich für ihre in der Bundesrepublik Deutschland stationierten Truppen gehörten zu den zentralen Themen der Kabinettsberatungen des Jahres 1966. Komplizierte Passierscheinverhandlungen, die Fragen rund um einen Redneraustausch zwischen SED und SPD und die Befürchtungen einer möglichen Anerkennung der DDR prägten die innerdeutschen Beziehungen. Rückläufiges Wirtschaftswachstum und erste Anzeichen einer Rezession waren weitere Herausforderungen für die Bundesregierung. Im Streit um die Regulierung steigender Haushaltsdefizite zerbrach im Herbst die christlich-liberale Koalition. Der Rücktritt Erhards ebnete den Weg für die erste Große Koalition unter Kiesinger.'],\n",

Oldenbourg Verlag München 2012ISBN 978-3-486-71727-3\\nNach Überwindung der Rezession und erfolgreicher Umsetzung wesentlicher Reformvorhaben wie der Notstandsgesetzgebung und der Finanz- und Haushaltsreform traten im Laufe des Jahres 1969 die inhaltlichen Gegensätze innerhalb der Großen Koalition wieder deutlicher hervor, etwa in der Diskussion über eine mögliche Aufwertung der DM. Ebenfalls mit unterschiedlichen Akzentsetzungen wurde im Kabinett beraten über Bedrohungen der demokratischen Staatsordnung von links durch die Studentenbewegung bzw. von rechts durch die NPD und rechtsextremistische Publikationen sowie über die Frage einer Verfolgungsverjährung für schwerste NS-Verbrechen. Auf außenpolitischem Gebiet standen nach wie vor die Unterzeichnung des Nichtverbreitungsabkommens und der Umgang mit den zunehmend erfolgreichen Anerkennungsbestrebungen der DDR gegenüber Staaten der Dritten Welt auf der Tagesordnung. Im Gefolge der Bundestagswahlen im Herbst 1969 vollzog sich nach 20 Jahren CDU-geführter Bundesregierungen mit der Bildung einer sozialliberalen Koalition unter Bundeskanzler Willy Brandt ein „Machtwechsel“, der sich im selben Jahr bereits bei der Wahl Gustav Heinemanns zum Bundespräsidenten angekündigt hatte.'],\n",

Für heftige innenpolitische Diskussionen sorgte 20 Jahre nach dem Ende des Zweiten Weltkriegs die drohende Verjährung schwerster nationalsozialistischer Verbrechen. Das Verhältnis zwischen den Koalitionspartnern CDU/CSU und FDP war durch Differenzen auf nahezu allen wichtigen Gebieten zunehmend belastet. Dennoch wirkte der über Jahre aufgebaute Nimbus Ludwig Erhards als Vater des Wirtschaftswunders stark genug, um im Herbst 1965 mit einem eindrucksvollen Wahlsieg eine Fortsetzung der Koalition zu ermöglichen.'],\n",

Fehlt der Vermerk, so sorgt der Staatssekretär des Bundeskanzleramtes dafür, daß er nachgeholt wird.Ist keine mündliche Erörterung im Kabinett erforderlich, so ist bei der Vorlage zu bemerken, daß ein Beschluß auf schriftlichem Wege ausreichen wird (§ 20 Abs. 2).\\n§ 17\\nMeinungsverschiedenheiten zwischen den Bundesministern sind der Bundesregierung erst zu unterbreiten, wenn ein persönlicher Verständigungsversuch zwischen den beteiligten Bundesministern oder im Falle ihrer Behinderung zwischen ihren Vertretern ohne Erfolg geblieben ist.Der Bundeskanzler kann Meinungsverschiedenheiten vor der Beratung im Kabinett zunächst in einer Ministerbesprechung mit den beteiligten Bundesministern unter seinem Vorsitz erörtern.\\n§ 18\\nVorschläge zur Ernennung von Beamten und zur Anstellung von Angestellten sind in den Fällen des § 15 Abs. 2 Buchst. a) und b) vor jeder entscheidenden oder verpflichtenden Maßnahme oder Mitteilung der Bundesregierung zu unterbreiten; in den übrigen Fällen sind sie, sofern es sich um Beamte des höheren Dienstes (Gruppe A 2 c 2 und höher) und die ihnen gleichgestellten Angestellten in den Ministerien handelt, dem Bundeskanzler zur Kenntnis mitzuteilen.Ernennungen dürfen erst nach Vollziehung der Urkunde durch den Bundespräsidenten veröffentlicht werden.\\n§ 19Soll ein Beamter der Gruppe B 4 oder höherer Gruppen der Besoldungsordnung entlassen, in den Wartestand oder in den Ruhestand versetzt werden, so ist vor entscheidenden und verpflichtenden Maßnahmen oder Mitteilungen die Stellungnahme des Bundeskanzlers einzuholen.

Wird Widerspruch erhoben, so ist über die Angelegenheit in einer weiteren Sitzung der Bundesregierung erneut abzustimmen. Die Durchführung der Angelegenheit, der der Bundesminister der Finanzen widersprochen hat, muß unterbleiben, wenn sie nicht in der neuen Abstimmung in Anwesenheit des Bundesministers der Finanzen oder seines Vertreters von der Mehrheit sämtlicher Bundesminister beschlossen wird und der Bundeskanzler mit der Mehrheit gestimmt hat.Entsprechendes gilt, wenn der Bundesminister der Justiz oder der Bundesminister des Innern gegen einen Gesetz- oder Verordnungsentwurf oder eine Maßnahme der Bundesregierung wegen ihrer Unvereinbarkeit mit geltendem Recht Widerspruch erhebt.\\n§ 27\\nÜber die Sitzungen der Bundesregierung wird eine Niederschrift aufgenommen, die von dem Schriftführer unterzeichnet wird.

Berührt der Inhalt des Gesetzes den Geschäftsbereich mehrerer Bundesminister, so zeichnen diese in der Regel auch die Ausfertigung.Verfügungen und Anordnungen sind dem Bundespräsidenten erst nach der Gegenzeichnung durch den zuständigen Bundesminister zur Vollziehung vorzulegen. Absatz 1 Satz 2 gilt entsprechend.\\n§ 30\\nVerordnungen der Bundesregierung werden nach Gegenzeichnung durch den zuständigen Fachminister vom Bundeskanzler gezeichnet. Sonstige Verordnungen werden - auch wenn sie der Bundesregierung vorgelegen haben - grundsätzlich von dem zuständigen Bundesminister allein gezeichnet.Unter der ausdrücklichen Bezeichnung »Die Bundesregierung« sollen - abgesehen von Fällen besonderer Ermächtigung durch die Bundesregierung - nur der Bundeskanzler oder mit ihm der zuständige oder alle Bundesminister zeichnen.\\n§ 31Die präsidierenden Mitglieder der Landesregierungen sollen mehrmals im Jahre persönlich zu gemeinsamen Besprechungen mit der Bundesregierung vom Bundeskanzler eingeladen werden, um wichtige politische, wirtschaftliche, soziale und finanzielle Fragen zu erörtern und in persönlicher Fühlungnahme zu einer verständnisvollen einheitlichen Politik in Bund und Ländern beizutragen.'],\n",

Kabinettsausschüsse, zu deren Teilnehmerkreis Minister und Staatssekretäre, aber auch Abteilungsleiter und in Einzelfragen andere Ministerialbeamte sowie in Einzelfragen unabhängige Sachverständige zählten, sollten wesentliche Entscheidungen vorbereiten bzw. weiter beraten und damit die Arbeit des Kabinetts wesentlich entlasten. Ihre Protokolle sind deshalb als direkte Ergänzung zu den Kabinettsberatungen zu sehen.\\nIm Frühjahr 1951 wurde der Kabinettausschuss für Wirtschaft, im Sommer 1955 der Ministerausschuss für die Sozialreform gegründet. Ab Mitte der 60er Jahre entstanden weitere Kabinettsausschüsse, deren Tätigkeit sich zumeist auf die Dauer einer Legislaturperiode beschränkte.'],\n",

Für alle nunmehr online vorliegenden Protokolle gelten die seit dem Jahresband 1957 angewandten und den Anforderungen einer Internetpräsentation angepassten Editionsgrundsätze. Angleichungen wurden nur da vorgenommen, wo es für die Funktionalität des Internetauftritts unabdingbar war. Wegen weiterer Einzelheiten sei hier auf die entsprechenden Abschnitte in den Jahresbänden der Buchversion verwiesen.\\nTextgrundlage\\n\\nKommentierung\\n\\nTextpräsentation\\n\\nZitationsweise\\n\\xa0Textgrundlage\\xa0Gegenstand der Edition›Die Kabinettsprotokolle der Bundesregierung‹ online sind die Sitzungsniederschriften des Bundeskabinetts sowie seiner Kabinettsausschüsse, die als Kurzprotokolle von Referenten des Bundeskanzleramts angefertigt wurden. Sie werden seit 1982 vom Bundesarchiv aufgrund des Auftrags der Bundesregierung aus dem Jahr 1979 als wissenschaftliche Edition zunächst in Buchform veröffentlicht.Die Protokolltexte wurden bis 1998 als geheime Verschlusssache in der Registratur des Bundeskanzleramts verwahrt und nach der Abgabe an das Bundesarchiv dort dem Bestand Bundeskanzleramt (B\\xa0136) zugeordnet. Die Mitschriften der Kabinettssitzungen sind bis zum Ende der 4. Wahlperiode im Herbst 1965 in zwei Serien - Entwürfe und Ausfertigungen - organisiert; die Sitzungsprotokolle des Kabinettsausschusses für Wirtschaft sowie des Ministerausschusses für die Sozialreform sind in einer einzigen Serie zusammengefasst.Die Edition präsentiert den Text der Protokollausfertigungen in ungekürzter, aber im Layout aufbereiteter Form. Von den Ausfertigungen abweichende Entwurfsstadien wurden im Anmerkungsapparat nur dann nachgewiesen, wenn es inhaltlich angemessen erschien. Auch die der Entwurfsserie beigefügten Einladungen und deren Anlagen sowie das in die Protokollserien aufgenommenen Schriftstücke sind von der Veröffentlichung ausgenommen. Nachträgliche Protokollkorrekturen - in der Regel dem ausgefertigten Protokoll als Anhang beigefügt - sind bei inhaltliche Relevanz dagegen berücksichtigt und die ursprünglichen Textfassungen der Ausfertigungen in den Anmerkungen nachgewiesen.Für die Jahre 1949 und 1950 enthält die Entwurfsserie des Bundeskanzleramtes zusätzlich stenographische Mitschriften von sechs Kabinettssitzungen, die als Wortprotokolle innerhalb des ersten Jahresbandes 1949 bzw. für 1950 in einem eigenen Band veröffentlicht wurden.\\nÜbersicht über die Serien der Ausfertigungen der Kabinettsprotokolle im Bestand des Bundeskanzleramtes (B\\xa0136)\\n            Kabinett 1949\\n            1.-32.

In Zweifelsfällen sind die Korrekturen der Bearbeiter kenntlich gemacht. Darüber hinaus sind keine Vereinheitlichungen und Normalisierungen - auch nicht im Hinblick auf die seit 1998 für den behördlichen Gebrauch eingeführten Rechtschreibregeln - vorgenommen worden.Die sprechenden Personen, die im Protokolltext der Vorlage in der Regel durch Unterstreichungen markiert wurden, sind ab dem Jahresband 1957 in der Edition im Kursivsatz wiedergegeben.\\xa0ProtokollkopfDie Protokollteile Überschrift, Teilnehmer sowie Zeit und Ort der Sitzungen wurden von den Bearbeitern gestaltet. Sie enthalten in einheitlicher und übersichtlicher Form die den Textvorlagen entnommenen Angaben. Dabei entspricht die Reihenfolge der genannten Teilnehmer der Vorlage, die sich wiederum hinsichtlich der Bundesminister nach der amtlichen Reihenfolge der Ministerien richtet. Bundesminister, Staatssekretäre und andere Sitzungsteilnehmer sind durch Semikola voneinander abgetrennt. Soweit dies nicht bereits in den Vorlagen geschehen war, sind seit dem Jahresband 1957 bei der Nennung der Ministerialbeamten stillschweigend das entsendende Ressort, bei den sonstigen Sitzungsteilnehmern entsprechende Hinweise auf ihre Funktion hinzugefügt worden.\\xa0Tagesordnung und TagesordnungspunkteBis zum Jahresband 1956 wurden die den Sitzungsprotokollen vorangestellten Tagesordnungen in den Editionsbänden nicht abgedruckt. Für die Jahresbände ab 1957 bzw. für die editierten Protokolle des Kabinettsausschusses für Wirtschaft und des Ministerausschusses für die Sozialreform sind sie auf der Grundlage der Protokollausfertigungen übernommen worden. Die Angaben zu den Kabinettsvorlagen einschließlich der Akten- bzw. Geschäftszeichen stammen aus den Einladungsschreiben und sind gegebenenfalls ohne besondere Kennzeichnung von den Bearbeitern so weit wie erforderlich und möglich vervollständigt worden.Die Formulierung der Tagesordnungspunkte in den edierten Protokolltexten entspricht grundsätzlich dem Wortlaut der Vorlagen. Das für den jeweiligen Tagesordnungspunkt federführende Ressort wurde nach der Überschrift dann angefügt, wenn dessen Nennung auch Bestandteil der Tagesordnung in den Textvorlagen war.Ordentliche Tagesordnungspunkte wurden in den Protokollausfertigungen in der Regel durchgehend nummeriert und sind in dieser Zählung in die Edition übernommen worden. Außerordentliche Tagesordnungspunkte waren dagegen in den Protokollvorlagen meistens nicht nummeriert. Um jedem Tagesordnungspunkt eine eindeutige Kennzeichnung zu geben, wurden deshalb in der Edition alle außerhalb der Tagesordnung behandelten Punkte grundsätzlich mit fortlaufenden Großbuchstaben in eckigen Klammern markiert. Ordentliche einzige Punkte der Tagesordnung sind in den edierten Protokolltexten im Interesse der Zitierfähigkeit durch die Ziffer 1 in eckigen Klammern gekennzeichnet.Außerhalb der ordentlichen Tagesordnung stehende und vom Protokollanten nicht eigens überschriebene Textpassagen sind durch die Bearbeiter zur besseren inhaltlichen Überschaubarkeit mit Überschriften versehen worden. Diese nachträglich gebildeten Überschriften sind durch eckige Klammern gekennzeichnet und werden, wie außerordentliche Tagesordnungspunkte, mit Großbuchstaben eingeführt.\\xa0ParallelüberlieferungenMit den Sitzungsmitschriften der Minister Hans-Christoph Seebohm und Hans-Joachim von Merkatz stehen Parallelüberlieferungen zu den Kabinettsprotokollen zur Verfügung. Sie wurden, soweit sie aussagekräftig sind, zur Kommentierung insbesondere jener Tagesordnungspunkte herangezogen, zu denen kein amtliches Protokoll vorliegt und zum Teil in den Protokolltext inseriert. Dies betrifft hauptsächlich die auf die Bundesminister beschränkten Sitzungsabschnitte. Weitere ergänzende Informationen zu Inhalt und Verlauf der Kabinettsberatungen sind den Mitschriften oder z.T. ausführlichen Vermerken anderer Sitzungsteilnehmer zu entnehmen, wie z.\\xa0B. von Bundesfinanzminister Schäffer für Staatsekretär Hartmann, von Staatssekretär Hallstein oder des Ministerialdirektors im Bundesministerium für Angelegenheiten des Bundesrates und der Länder, Renatus Weber.\\xa0Kommentierung\\xa0KommentarDer in den Anmerkungen präsentierte Kommentar zu den Protokolltexten verfolgt mehrere Ziele. Neben der textkritischen Beschreibung des Textkorpus dienen die Anmerkungen zunächst dazu, den Protokolltext verständlich zu machen und an den Beratungsgegenstand heranzuführen. Nicht allgemein bekannte Ereignisse und Institutionen sowie heute ungebräuchliche Begriffe werden bei ihrer ersten Erwähnung erläutert. Im Protokolltext erwähnte Besprechungen, Schreiben, Vermerke, Gesetzestexte, Drucksachen, Zeitungsartikel usw. werden verifiziert und deren Fundstellen dokumentiert. Insbesondere ist beabsichtigt, die zu den Beratungsgegenständen entstandene und im Bundesarchiv, aber auch in anderen Archiven verwahrte archivische Überlieferung so weit möglich nachzuweisen. Vor allem gilt das für die den Kabinettsberatungen zu Grunde liegenden Kabinettsvorlagen, die in den Beständen des jeweils federführenden Ressorts im Bundesarchiv oder im Politischen Archiv des Auswärtigen Amts bzw. auch im Bestand Bundeskanzleramt im Bundesarchiv überliefert sind. Darüber hinaus soll dem Benutzer der Edition durch die Bezeichnung weiterer Unterlagen der zuständigen und qualifiziert beteiligten Ressorts der gezielte Einstieg in die einschlägige Sachaktenüberlieferung ermöglicht werden. Auch auf Unterlagen in den verfügbaren Nachlässen von Kabinettsmitgliedern im Bundesarchiv und in den Parteiarchiven wird gegebenenfalls hingewiesen.Die als Hyperlinks erkennbaren Rückverweise, Fortgänge und Querverweise lassen im Kommentar den Verlauf der Beratungen einer Angelegenheit sowohl im Kabinett als gegebenenfalls auch im Kabinettsausschuss für Wirtschaft bzw. im Ministerausschuss für die Sozialreform nachvollziehbar werden. Gleiches gilt für die Beratungen in den Ausschüssen.Hinsichtlich der im Kabinett besprochenen Gesetz- oder Verordnungsentwürfe wird auf die Nachzeichnung der sich an den Kabinettsbeschluss anschließenden parlamentarischen Behandlung verzichtet, sofern die Angelegenheit nicht wieder aus den Gesetzgebungskörperschaften ins Kabinett zurückkam. Nachgewiesen werden in jedem Fall die betreffenden Drucksachen des Bundesrats und des Bundestags und zwar mit den Nummern, welche die Regierungsvorlagen jeweils für die erste Behandlung dort erhielten. Abgeschlossen wird die Kommentierung mit dem Hinweis auf die amtliche Veröffentlichung von Gesetzen, Verordnungen, Regierungsabkommen, Beschlüssen oder Verlautbarungen. Wissenschaftliche Literatur wird nur dann angegeben, wenn der Sachkommentar dadurch wesentlich entlastet werden kann. Die im Kommentar verwendeten Kurztitel sind im jeweiligen Quellen- und Literaturverzeichnis aufgelöst.\\xa0Biographische AngabenAlle in den Dokumentenköpfen aufgeführten Sitzungsteilnehmer sind mit biographischen Angaben, insbesondere zum beruflichen Werdegang, in einer besonderen Zusammenstellung im Navigationsbaum unter dem Auswahlpunkt ›Personen‹ aufgeführt. Sonstige im Protokolltext namentlich genannte Personen erhalten bei ihrer ersten Nennung eine biographische Anmerkung.Für die Jahresbände 1949 bis 1956 umfasst die Auflistung nur die in der Geschäftsordnung der Bundesregierung bestimmten regelmäßigen Sitzungsteilnehmer. Die übrigen Teilnehmer werden, wie auch die sonstigen namentlich genannten Personen, bei ihrer ersten Nennung mit einer biographischen Anmerkung versehen.\\xa0PersonalienSind bei den Kabinettsberatungen zu Personalsachen Namen nur den Anlagen zu entnehmen, so beschreibt der Kommentar zusammenfassend, welche und wie viele Positionen in den jeweiligen Ministerien und deren Geschäftsbereich besetzt werden sollten. Erst ab der Besetzung von Abteilungsleiterstellen in einem Ministerium (Ministerialdirektoren, gelegentlich auch Ministerialdirigenten) und von auswärtigen Vertretungen (einschließlich Konsulaten) sowie ab der Ernennung von Brigadegeneralen, von Bundesrichtern, Oberfinanz- und Senatspräsidenten, Präsidenten von Landesarbeitsämtern, Bundesbahn- und Oberpostdirektionen und anderen Leitern, im allgemeinen auch stellvertretenden Leitern von Bundesbehörden wurden die im Protokoll nicht genannten Namen aus den (nicht abgedruckten) Anlagen in die Anmerkungen übernommen.\\xa0Weitere Teile der EditionDie in jedem Editionsband den Protokolltexten\\n        vorangestellte Einleitung ordnet die Kabinettsberatungen in den\\n        allgemeinen ereignisgeschichtlichen Rahmen des jeweiligen Jahres ein und\\n        gibt eine sachliche Einführung zu den im Kabinett behandelten Themen. Jedem Band beigegeben sind neben dem erwähnten biographischen Verzeichnis eine Zeittafel sowie ein Quellen- und Literaturverzeichnis.\\xa0Textpräsentation\\xa0TextgestaltungDer Baum im linken Frame ersetzt jeweils das Verzeichnis der Sitzungen und Tagesordnungspunkte der Buchversion.Die Protokollköpfe mit den Angaben zu Teilnehmern, Ort, Zeit und Tagesordnung sowie die Tagesordnungspunkte (TOP) sind im rechten Frame oben einzeln dargestellt.  Vereinzelt wurden Protokollüberschriften der heute\\n        gebräuchlichen Form angepasst und TOP-Überschriften ergänzt oder\\n        hinzugefügt. \\nBei einer gemeinsamen Behandlung von zwei TOPs weist ein Zusatz auf die entsprechende Stelle im Protokolltext hin, z.\\xa0B.: ›[Siehe unter Punkt 2 dieser Sitzung.]‹. Bei nicht protokollierten TOPs wurde analog verfahren, z.\\xa0B. ›[Dieser TOP wurde nicht protokolliert.]‹Textteile wie ›Außerhalb der Tagesordnung -, die den protokollarischen Sitzungsverlauf dokumentieren, wurden bei Bedarf mit einem Textzusatz versehen wie z.\\xa0B. ›[Es folgen TOP ... ]‹.Der Sachkommentar erscheint im rechten unteren Frame. Verweise auf die vorhergehende bzw. nachfolgen substantielle Behandlung eines Themas im Kabinett aber auch in dessen Ausschüssen sind als Hyperlinks erkenn- und nutzbar.Im Interesse einer bandübergreifenden Recherche wurde das in den Verweisen der früheren Bände nicht aufgeführte Datum der jeweiligen Kabinettssitzung nachgetragen.Die biographischen Angaben (bis 1955) wurden nicht\\n        systematisch ergänzt bzw. überarbeitet.Der Band 3 der Buchedition (Wortprotokolle 1950) wurde\\n        funktional in den Band 2 (Kabinettsprotokolle 1950) integriert.\\n\\xa0Geschäftsordnung der BundesregierungDie seit den Kabinettsprotokollen 1955 in allen folgenden Bänden im Anhang abgedruckte Geschäftsordnung der Bundesregierung wurde für die Internetausgabe nur an einer Stelle - auf der Startseite - eingestellt.\\xa0Geleitworte und EditionsgrundsätzeDie bisher den einzelnen Editionsbänden vorangestellten Geleitworte und Editionsgrundsätze wurden nicht in die Internetversion übernommen. Statt dessen wurde von ihnen auf der Startseite eine für alle Bände geltende Fassung bereitgestellt.\\xa0IndicesAngesichts der Möglichkeiten einer Volltextrecherche sind die Indices ebenfalls entfallen. Allerdings wurden die Namen aus den Personenindices in eine Personenliste übernommen und mit der Suchfunktion verknüpft.\\xa0AbkürzungenDie Auflösung von Abkürzungen erfolgt als pop-up durch Mouse-over (Berührung mit dem Cursor); daher wurde auf die Wiedergabe der in den gedruckten Bänden vorhandenen Abkürzungsverzeichnisse verzichtet.\\xa0BiographienZusätzlich zu dem Auswahlpunkt ›Personen‹, der innerhalb des aktuell angesteuerten Bandes zur Liste der Sitzungsteilnehmer\\xa0 führt, wurde für die Online-Präsentation der Kabinettsprotokolle ein Hauptpunkt ›Biographien‹ eingerichtet, der die ständig aktualisierten biographischen Notizen zu allen in den Bänden genannten Personen zusammenführt und unmittelbar zugänglich macht.\\xa0DokumentenanhangDie Kabinettsprotokolle 1950 sowie die Bände des Kabinettsausschusses für Wirtschaft und des Ministerausschusses für die Sozialreform verfügen über Dokumentenanhänge, die zur Entlastung des Kommentars ausgewählte Kabinettsvorlagen und Schreiben wiedergeben. Diese sind über den Bereich ›Dokumente‹ im Baum greifbar aber von der Volltextsuche ausgeschlossen.\\xa0WortprotokolleDie Wortprotokolle der Jahre 1949, 1950 und 1962 wurden für die Internetversion jeweils als eigener Gliederungspunkt dargestellt und sind über den Suchbereich ›Protokolle‹ und über die Volltextsuche recherchierbar.Für das Jahr 1950 wurden die Quellen- und Literaturverzeichnisse sowie die Personenlisten der beiden Bände Kabinettsprotokolle und Wortprotokolle zusammengeführt. Dabei wurden Personen, die ausschließlich im Dokumentenanhang 1950 vorkommen, nicht berücksichtigt.Die Einleitung zu den Wortprotokollen aus dem Jahr 1950 wurde an die Einleitung des entsprechenden Jahresbandes auf der Ebene der Zwischenüberschriften angefügt.\\xa0Abschnitte ›Quellenlage‹Die in den Bänden 1949 bis 1952 und 1954 den Editionsgrundsätzen vorangestellten Abschnitte ›Quellenlage‹ wurden als erste Zwischenüberschrift der jeweiligen Bandeinleitung zugeordnet.\\xa0AnwesenheitsübersichtDie Jahresbände 1950 bis 1959 enthalten eine von den Bearbeitern zusammengestellte und in die Anhänge aufgenommene ›Übersicht zur Anwesenheit der regelmäßigen Teilnehmer an den Kabinettssitzungen‹ des jeweiligen Jahres. Diese Übersicht steht im Navigationsbaum unter ›Anwesenheitsübersicht‹ als PDF-Dokument zur Verfügung. Gleiches gilt für den ›Kabinettsausschuß für Wirtschaft 1956-1957‹ und den ›Ministerausschuß für die Sozialreform 1955-1960‹.\\xa0ZitationsweiseBei der Verwendung von Zitaten aufgrund der Internetversion wird folgende Zitation vorgeschlagen.\\xa0Beispiele:67.

Außenpolitisch sah sich die Bundesregierung im Falle des Zypern- und des Vietnamkonflikts mit der noch ungewohnten Möglichkeit eines auch militärischen Engagements im Ausland konfrontiert. Die Weiterentwicklung der EWG blieb geprägt von zähen Auseinandersetzungen um die Harmonisierung von Zöllen und Agrarpreisen. Im Innern versuchte die Bundesregierung, das Wachstum des Bundeshaushalts in Grenzen zu halten und durch Erweiterung des konjunkturpolitischen Instrumentariums die wirtschaftliche Entwicklung zu steuern. Mit dem Frankfurter „Auschwitz-Prozess“ und der Debatte um die Verjährung der Strafverfolgung von NS-Verbrechen trat die Diskussion um den Umgang mit der NS-Vergangenheit in eine neue Phase.'],\n",

Konrad Adenauer wurde zum dritten Male zum Bundeskanzler gewählt. Zugeständnisse an Wählerschichten und Interessensgruppen bestimmten die Kabinettsberatungen ebenso wie die parteipolitischen Auseinandersetzungen um die Atombewaffnung und Wiedervereinigung. Neben einer Politik der Westbindung suchte Adenauer zugleich die Annäherung zur Sowjetunion, die nach einem intensiven Briefwechsel zur Aufnahme von Wirtschaftsverhandlungen führte. Die Anerkennung der DDR durch Jugoslawien wirkte sich zunächst kaum auf die deutsch-sowjetischen Kontakte aus, wenngleich der Abbruch der diplomatischen Beziehungen zu Jugoslawien die Beziehungen der Bundesrepublik zu den Staaten des Ostblocks belastete und den Handlungsspielraum in der Deutschland- und Außenpolitik nachhaltig zu beeinträchtigen begann.'],\n",

Oldenbourg Verlag München 2002ISBN 978-3-486-56566-9\\nDer sowjetische Vorschlag einer Gipfelkonferenz und das Berlin-Ultimatum Chruschtschows bildeten vor dem Hintergrund des sich verschärfenden Ost-West-Konflikts im Jahre 1958 den Rahmen für die Bemühungen der Bundesregierung um eine Lösung der deutschen Frage. Gleichzeitig kennzeichneten der Aufbau der europäischen Institutionen und die wachsenden Verpflichtungen der Bundesrepublik im westlichen Verteidigungsbündnis den fortschreitenden Prozess ihrer Westintegration. Dazu gehörten auch die Bestrebungen der Bundesregierung, einen Ausgleich in den durch die Ereignisse des Zweiten Weltkrieges immer noch belasteten Beziehungen zu den westlichen Nachbarstaaten zu finden. In diesem Zusammenhang ist besonders die deutsch-französische Annäherung zu nennen, die durch persönliche Begegnungen Adenauers mit dem neuen französischen Ministerpräsidenten de Gaulle in Colombey-les-deux-Eglises und Bad Kreuznach eingeleitet wurde. Zu den innenpolitisch vorherrschenden Themen dieses Jahres zählte die Auseinandersetzung um die Frage der atomaren Aufrüstung der Bundeswehr, die in der Anti-Atomtod-Bewegung ihren deutlichen Ausdruck fand. Unruhe in der Bevölkerung verursachte auch die Kohlenkrise, die die Bundesregierung durch ein Bündel von Maßnahmen einzudämmen suchte. Daneben nahm sie umfangreiche Reformvorhaben in Angriff, die u. a. das Steuer- und Aktienrecht, die Notstands- und Parteiengesetzgebung, das Rundfunkwesen und die soziale Krankenversicherung betrafen.'],\n",

Wichtige außenpolitische Beratungsthemen des Kabinetts waren der Atomwaffensperrvertrag, die Devisenausgleichsverhandlungen mit den USA und Großbritannien und die Verbesserung der Beziehungen zur DDR und zu den osteuropäischen Staaten.

              "  'Kabinett\\nAuf der Grundlage des 1979 von der Bundesregierung dem Bundesarchiv erteilten Auftrags, die Kabinettsprotokolle der Bundesregierung in wissenschaftlicher Form zu veröffentlichen, hat sich inzwischen eine vielbändige Editionsreihe entwickelt.\\nAngesichts dieser auch weiterhin anwachsenden Informationsfülle lag es nahe, die Informationstechnik für die Erschließung der Texte zu nutzen. Die Online-Version der edierten Kabinettsprotokolle steht seit 2003 im Internet bereit. Sie macht die für die Erforschung der Geschichte der Bundesrepublik Deutschland zentrale Quelle der Kabinettsprotokolle einem deutlich breiteren Benutzerkreis zugänglich. Ihr entscheidender Mehrwert liegt in der Erleichterung und Erweiterung der Recherchemöglichkeiten. Neben gezielter Suche und raschem Zugriff auch auf detaillierte Informationen ermöglicht sie mittels kombinierter Suchstrategien auch Abfragen komplexer Sachverhalte sowie neue Methoden und Wege der Textauswertung. Gleichzeitig erleichtert sie durch ein Navigationssystem die Orientierung in einem immer umfangreicher werdenden Text. Ferner ist die digitale Version besonders dazu geeignet, das im Editionskonzept enthaltene System von Vor- und Rückverweisen zu unterstützen. Eine Verlinkung der einzelnen Tagesordnungspunkte untereinander erlaubt es, den Beratungsverlauf im Kabinett und in seinen Ausschüssen auch über die tradierten Band- und Jahresgrenzen hinaus im gesamten anwachsenden Corpus der Protokolltexte zu verfolgen.\\nNicht zuletzt besteht der Gewinn einer Internet-Version der Edition darin, die Quellenangaben in den Kommentaren der Kabinettsprotokolle mit den Bestandsübersichten des Bundesarchivs zu verknüpfen. Mit diesem Zugang zu anderen, teilweise erst im Aufbau befindlichen Online-Dienstleistungen entspricht das Bundesarchiv auch der Zielsetzung der Bundesregierung, alle internetfähigen Dienstleistungen der Bundesverwaltung online bereitzustellen.\\nDer wesentliche Vorteil der digitalen Version der Edition ist die Mehrdimensionalität des Zugriffs. Die weiterhin im Buchdruck erscheinende Version des Editionswerks, die sequentielles Lesen ermöglicht und Zitierbarkeit auch in klassischer Form sicherstellt, behält daneben ihre Berechtigung.\\nIn Ergänzung des wissenschaftlichen Editionswerks in seiner gedruckten und seiner digitalen Form konnte nach der erforderlichen Anpassung der rechtlichen Rahmenbedingungen das Bundesarchiv 2013 auf der vorliegenden Internet-Seite in einem Zuge diejenigen bereits schutzfristfreien 13 Jahrgänge der Kabinettsprotokolle der Öffentlichkeit präsentieren, zu denen bis dahin noch kein editorischer Sachkommentar erstellt worden war. Seitdem werden diese insoweit noch unkommentierten, jedoch schon textkritisch bearbeiteten Protokolle kontinuierlich entlang der archivrechtlichen 30-Jahresschutzfrist jahrgangsweise ergänzt. Sie sind in klarer Abgrenzung von den bereits abschließend kommentierten Protokolljahrgängen auf der Ebene der einzelnen Tagesordnungspunkte entsprechend gekennzeichnet, und sie bleiben als Übergangsangebot jeweils nur solange im Internet eingestellt, bis sie durch die einschlägigen Jahrgänge der Online-Version der Edition nach deren Abschluss ersetzt werden können.'],\n",

Der Ausgleich des Bundeshaushalts wurde durch Ansprüche unterschiedlicher Akteure wie der NATO-Bündnispartner oder der Beamten und Arbeitnehmer des Bundes erschwert. Vor diesem Hintergrund war die Neuregelung von Lohnfortzahlung, Kindergeld und Krankenversicherung umstritten. Der Erhaltung des gesamtwirtschaftlichen Gleichgewichts dienten Maßhalteappelle an die Tarifpartner und Versuche, auf die Preispolitik Einfluss zu nehmen. Beschleunigt durch die Kuba-Krise und die anhaltende Bedrohung Berlins verabschiedete die Bundesregierung die Entwürfe einer Notstandsgesetzgebung.'],\n",

Oldenbourg Verlag München 2006ISBN 978-3-486-57918-5\\nInnenpolitisch war das Jahr 1963 geprägt durch den Kanzlerwechsel von Adenauer zu Erhard, durch die Auseinandersetzungen um die Kriegsfolge- und Wiedergutmachungsgesetzgebung sowie um die Steuer- und Haushaltspolitik und die Folgen der Spiegel-Affäre. Aufsehen erregten Berichte über die Verletzung des Brief- und Fernmeldegeheimnisses durch den  Verfassungsschutz. Im Mittelpunkt der außenpolitischen Themen der Kabinettsberatungen standen das Scheitern des Beitritts Großbritanniens zur EWG, die Agrarpolitik der Gemeinschaft, der deutsch-französische Freundschaftsvertrag sowie das Röhrenembargo, der Besuch von US-Präsident Kennedy und das Atomteststopp-Abkommen.'],\n",

Oldenbourg Verlag München 2004ISBN 978-3-486-57584-2\\nDer andauernde Ost-West-Konflikt um die Berlin- und Deutschland-Frage kulminierte am 13. August 1961 im Bau der Berliner Mauer. Auf diese bedrohliche zugespitzte Situation reagierte die Bundesregierung u.a. mit einer vorübergehenden Verstärkung der Bundeswehr. Diese Ereignisse stellten gleichzeitig den deutschlandpolitischen Kurs von Bundeskanzler Adenauer in Frage, dessen Autorität durch den Verlust der absoluten Mehrheit bei den Bundestagswahlen im September 1961 zusätzlich erschüttert wurde. Verbesserungen im Bereich der Landwirtschafts-, der Familien-, der Sozial- und der Vermögensbildungspolitik hatten diesen Stimmverlust nicht verhindern können. Mit dem Eichmann-Prozess in Jerusalem und dem Verfahren gegen Staatssekretär Globke fand die im Vorjahr eingeleitete Diskussion um den Umgang mit der NS-Vergangenheit ihre Fortsetzung.']]"
